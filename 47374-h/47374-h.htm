<h3>XXXI.&mdash;MR. T. SIDNEY COOPER, R.A.</h3>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_227.png" width="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> first sight I obtained of
Mr. Cooper was of considerable
interest. He lives in a
beautiful spot, about a mile
and a half from Canterbury&mdash;at
Vernon Holme, Harbledown;
and as I entered the gate I caught
sight of Mr. Cooper before his easel in his
studio, taking advantage of the light of a
glorious winter's day, and working away
at a canvas which I subsequently learnt
was intended, with another, to form his contribution
to this year's exhibition at the Royal
Academy. I stood for a moment quietly and
respectfully looking on before ringing the
bell at the front door. The canvas presented
a landscape, and the cattle were just
outlined in with pencil. The painter was working
without the aid of glasses, and this for a
man who is in his ninety-first year may
certainly be said to be highly respectable.
Somewhat below the medium height, with
marvellously penetrating eyes, scarcely the
sign of the stoop of old age, a hand as steady
as in '35, when he was just beginning to
make a name, and silvery white hair about
his head&mdash;it was an impressive picture.
T. Sidney Cooper's brilliant work of the
past and to-day calls for all recognition
of his gifts, but it is only when one
catches sight of him as I did&mdash;snow,
nothing but snow, everywhere outside,
and the painter,
now in the winter
of life, clinging
with all the old
love to his sheep
and cattle&mdash;it is
only then that one
realizes the great
respect due to
the Grand Old
Academician.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 611px;">
<img src="images/i_227b.jpg" width="611" height="377" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>VERNON HOLME&mdash;FROM THE POND.
<i>From a Photo. by Elliott &amp; Fry.</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>So I shook my
snow-covered
boots outside and
entered the hall
of Vernon Holme.
The artist left his
easel. It was a
hearty welcome
to Vernon Holme.
There was no
mistaking the man. He was living there a
quiet, happy, contented, and work-a-day life;
rising at half-past seven every morning in the
winter, and in the summer months at seven
o'clock. Before breakfast the palettes are set
and the paints made ready. He will work
steadily up to dusk. His recreation is his
Bible, and twice a day, after lunch and dinner,
a chapter is read aloud. His voice is clear, and
he reads every word, and suggests its meaning.
I heard Sidney Cooper read. His birthdays
are <i>thinking</i> days&mdash;<i>thankful</i> days too, it would
seem. The lines he wrote on September
26th, 1889, reveal much. He calls them
"Musings on My Eighty-sixth Birthday," and
they run:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Another birthday dawns&mdash;the eighty-sixth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How little take we note of fleeting time!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since last this day of joyful glee was here<br /></span>

<span class="i0">So full of mercies, be Thou still my help.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When o'er this day of life the night shall fall,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>Then he loves to take you about his house,
for it is a very beautiful home, and the man
who owns it enjoys its comforts the more, for
he will honestly tell you that it meant working
for.</p>

<p>"I don't do anything without authority,"
he told me; "I have authority for everything
I paint. If I want a sky for any particular
picture, I do it from my house. I have
windows from all four sides, so that I can see
always. Then in the summer I can sit on
the lawn and paint. There are some of my
sheep&mdash;my 'models'!"</p>

<p>We were standing in the recess of the
dining-room. Before us were the fields
covered with snow, and some sheep were
labouring hard to find a stray tuft of grass
here and there. Ever since the artist built
the house&mdash;forty-five years ago&mdash;he has kept
sheep here and painted them every year.
These finely coated creatures before us now
are admirable representatives of some ninety
ewes and a similar number of lambs. Of
bullocks, the great cattle painter has few,
though he invariably fattens up three or four
every autumn.</p>

<p>Some hours later we again stood in this
corner and watched the setting sun. A great
cloud edged with gold hung over a black
patch of trees.</p>

<p>"Ah!" exclaimed
Mr.
Cooper, enthusiastically,
"it
was in that very
wood that I first
began to study
trees. There were
some fine old
trees there&mdash;too
far gone to cut
for timber. A
farm stood on the
opposite side of
the hill, which I
have put in three
of my pictures.
How well I remember
seeing
the chains and
the gibbet in the
road which skirts
the wood there&mdash;used
for hanging
Charles Storey,
who committed murder the year after I
was born."</p>

<p>It is not necessary to say that the interior
of Vernon Holme is in every way worthy of
its owner. The land on which it stands was
originally a hop ground, and Mr. Cooper tells
with great gusto that whilst the people were
picking the hops his men were getting the
ground ready for the foundation of the house.
The house was built from Mr. Cooper's own
designs. The hall, of solid oak, is very fine
and massive, and the carving about the ceiling
and staircases exquisite. The bosses on the
ceiling were cut from Nature's models of
hops and wild flowers. The antlers over the
doors were a present from Sir Edwin Landseer,
and are reminiscences of deer shot by him in
Scotland. The engravings comprise proofs
after Sir Edwin and Tom Landseer, and
Leslie's "Coronation of Queen Victoria."</p>

<p>"There is a little story," said Mr. Cooper,
"as to how I came into possession of that
engraving&mdash;a very rare one&mdash;of Tom Landseer's.
I painted a little picture for him, and
Tom liked it. So it was agreed that I should
have some of his proofs in exchange for it.
He was very deaf, and he wrote on a piece
of paper: 'There's my portfolio; choose one,
and I'll sign it.' I did so.</p>

<p>"'Why,' he exclaimed, 'you have chosen
the one I put aside for myself.'</p>

<p>"I had selected the 'Deer and Dog in the
Snow.'"</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 602px;">
<img src="images/i_228.jpg" width="602" height="456" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>THE ENTRANCE HALL.</p>

<p><i>From a Photo. by Elliott &amp; Fry.</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>Only three pictures by Mr. Cooper hang<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
in the hall proper. These are over the
mantelpiece. One of these is peculiarly
interesting&mdash;a group of three sheep, a calf, and
a cow, painted three years ago. The work
was the result of a dream. The Royal Academician
dreamt he was painting this very
scene. In the morning he got up and
chronicled it on canvas. Ascending the
grand old staircase, a huge space is taken up
by "Separated, but not Divorced," painted in
1875, and is a study of a magnificent short-horn
bull, "Charlie" by name. It was
exhibited, but
proved too big
to sell. Just by
the bull's foreleg
is a raven pecking
at a bone.
The artist was
asked why he
put it there.</p>

<p>"Oh!" he replied,
"I wanted
a little bit of
relieving black
and white.
Besides, if there
is a Crown case
over it, it will
typify the lawyers
picking at
the bones."</p>

<p>But "Charlie"
is interesting for
other reasons. It
represents a
triumph of art.
Mrs. Cooper did
not like the
bull's head, and
said so. Mr.
Cooper made
up his mind to
paint in another
head. It took a
long time&mdash;many
and many were the attempts to put a new
head on old shoulders, and the one now in
the picture took as long to paint as all the rest
of the picture. It is a remarkably real and
brilliant effort. The other large picture by
Mr. Cooper is "Isaac's Substitute," painted
in 1880&mdash;a Scotch ram the only object
in the picture being Isaac's substitute. It
was suggested one day after reading the
words from Genesis xxii. 13: "And
Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked,
and behold behind him a ram caught in
a thicket by his horns." Close by are
some sheep painted on the 26th September,
1874, on the occasion of the artist's seventy-first
birthday. It was completed in five
hours, and here it should be mentioned that
for the last twenty years Mr. Cooper has
always painted a finished canvas on his birthday&mdash;pictures
which are never sold.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>SIDNEY COOPER, AGE 38.</p>

<p><i>From a Painting by Scott.</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>A peep into Mrs. Cooper's room revealed
something that says much for the continued
determination of purpose which has always
characterized the great painter's life, and his
extraordinary and persistent powers of endurance
under great
suffering. I had
noted some
excellent copies
of his father's
works by Mr.
Neville Cooper,
and a portrait
of the Royal
Academician
himself, painted
by Scott in 1841.
Also an old
donkey, done in
1835, belonging
to Mrs. Cooper&mdash;Mr.
Cooper
has been twice
married&mdash;seeing
that it was painted
in the year
in which she was
born. Two water
colour drawings
were then shown
to me. They
were artistic
reminiscences of
his severe illness
last year.
Beneath a group
of cows were
written these
words: "Painted
in bed, November, 1893, for my dear wife for
her nursing.&mdash;T.S.C., R.A." The other was
some sheep in the snow&mdash;reproduced in these
pages&mdash;and inscribed: "To Neville. Painted
in bed, with bronchitis, November, 1893.&mdash;T.S.C.,
R.A." Such efforts as these betoken
much. It is a significant fact that Sidney
Cooper was the last country patient the late
Sir Andrew Clark ever visited, for he was
struck down four days afterwards. The
great physician's words on saying "Good-bye"
to Mrs. Cooper were: "I never met a
man at eighty with more vitality in him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
than your husband, and he is ninety!" and
he added, upon being thanked for his prompt
attendance: "I look upon this as being one
of the events of my life."</p>

<div class="caption"><p>THE DINING-ROOM.</p>

<p><i>From a Photo. by Elliott &amp; Fry.</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>The dining-room is perhaps the finest
room in the house&mdash;being 35ft. long and
35ft. high. Its carved oak arched ceiling is
superb&mdash;and the carved fireplace, round
which ivy is trailing,
is also a fine
sample of this particular
art. It was
in this apartment
that I had the
privilege of going
through portfolio
after portfolio of
the daintiest of
pencil studies&mdash;little
artistic efforts
which seemed to
have life and
breath of their
own. There are
many personal
works here&mdash;at
one end of the
room hangs
"Scotch Mountains
and Sheep,"
the opposite side
being occupied by
the largest picture
the artist has ever painted&mdash;the canvas
measures 11ft, by 7ft.&mdash;"Pushing Off for
Tilbury Fort, on the Thames," painted in
1883, and exhibited in the Academy of the
following year.</p>

<p>As we stood before this beautiful work&mdash;a
scene of perfect calmness in the meadows,
with a group of cattle lazily lying in the fore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>ground,
and a boat full of soldiers being
rowed towards the guard-ship, <i>Ramilies</i>, in
the distance&mdash;Mr. Cooper said:</p>

<p>"I saw that very scene on my fortieth
birthday, when seeing a friend off from Tilbury.
Its beauty impressed me in a way few
such scenes have done, and I said within myself,
'Should I ever reach my eightieth birthday,
I will paint that.' And I did. I started
it on September 26, 1883, and it took me
exactly forty-nine
days to paint."</p>

<div class="caption"><p>THE DINING-ROOM.</p>

<p><i>From a Photo. by Elliott &amp; Fry.</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>There is much
of interest in the
drawing-room,
with its fine
statues by P.
MacDowell, R.A.,
its family portraits
intermingled with
great bowls of
winter blossoms
and grasses
gathered from the
adjoining fields,
its many artistic
treasures&mdash;not
omitting the tiny
canvas which the
artist painted at
the age of seventy.</p>

<p>"I painted it,"
he said, very
quietly, "because
I thought I had
got to the end!"</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 638px;">

<div class="caption"><p>THE DRAWING-ROOM.</p>

<p><i>From a Photo. by Elliott &amp; Fry.</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>But we only
spend a moment
or so there, for
Mr. Cooper is
leading the way
to the studio.
We cross the
great hall,
through the
library, whose
walls are completely
hidden by
sketches of,
surely, every
animal that ever
enjoyed the green
fare provided by
the meadows of
Britain&mdash;the
artist opens the
door and bids
me enter. It is
a remarkable
studio&mdash;and I should say stands alone
and distinct amongst those pertaining to
Royal Academicians. There are a few studies
hanging on the woodwork which surrounds
the window&mdash;there are the two diplomas, one
of which, dated November 3rd, 1845, made its
possessor an Associate of the Royal Academy,
and the other a Royal Academician on
March 23rd, 1867&mdash;but otherwise the blue
walls are bare, perfectly bare. There may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
a reason for this&mdash;a very simple one; an
honest recollection of the days that have been
is not to be forgotten
in the
comforts and
successes of the
days that are
now! When I
left Mr. Cooper,
and after I learnt
what I did, I
could only put
these bare walls
in the studio at
Vernon Holme
down to such
thoughts as these.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 463px;">

<div class="caption"><p>THE LIBRARY.</p>

<p><i>From a Photo. by Elliott &amp; Fry.</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>He told me
that the easels
and palettes are
all old friends&mdash;the
Academy box
on the floor is
chipped and cut
about, and goes
back to the
forties. It is not
worth a shilling; but a big cheque
wouldn't buy it. Packed against
the walls near the floor are scores
of canvases, studies innumerable,
old time and present-time first
artistic "thoughts." "Nancy Macintosh"
is particularly interesting,
because it is one of the artist's
figure studies of the time when
his work was just becoming to be
recognised&mdash;1836. Nancy was
painted in Cumberland under
Cross Fell, and is a good type of
the women who used to go up
and milk the cows for the drovers,
who&mdash;it is much to be regretted&mdash;used
to exchange their employers'
milk for nips of whisky! The
Academy pictures are even now
well forward. I was just looking at
one of these&mdash;a bridge scene, and
a subject the artist assured me he
had long been wanting to paint&mdash;when
I turned towards Mr. Cooper
again and found him in the act of
lifting a large canvas on to the
easel. He would not allow me to
assist him.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 620px;">

<div class="caption"><p>THE STUDIO.</p>

<p><i>From a Photo. by Elliott &amp; Fry.</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>"That," he said, after it had
been securely placed on the easel,
"is to be the picture of my life!
The subject is 'The High Hills,
or the Refuge for the Wild Goats,' from the
104th Psalm. It is not finished yet. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
notion occurred to me when last in Switzerland.
I had to go up the mountain some
four hours' journey before I reached the
spot from which the idea is partly composed.
We went as high as the goats would go in
order to get the moss, heather, and different
grasses on which they feed. As far as the

ones when in North Wales."</p>

<p>A flood of renewed light came in at
the studio window&mdash;for the afternoon was
still young&mdash;and Mr. Cooper stood for a
moment by the side of the picture and was
thus photographed. The light lit up the
canvas&mdash;so I left Mr. Cooper at work, and
spent the afternoon in wandering about the
Brotherhood Farm, where some of his sheep
and cows are to be found. It is a farm
possessing a distinct interest, for on a grassy
slope by the side of one of its meadows is
situated the well of the Black Prince&mdash;a well
roofed in by modern brick, over which the ivy
is growing, a sublimely picturesque corner,
where the first bearer of
the motto "Ich Dien"
was wont to come and
bathe his eyes.</p>

<p>"Why, sir," said the
old Sub-Prior with pardonable
pride when showing
me the well, "people
send from all over the
world for that water, and
the last gentleman that
had it was Mr. Sidney
Cooper, the painter."</p>

<p>Mr. Cooper told me
that he obtained the
water for a young lady in
his family.</p>

<p>It was nearing dusk
when I returned to
Vernon Holme, and once
again I saw the great
artist through the window
of his studio, packing up
his things and taking a
last look for the day at
his work on the easel.
We met in the hall.</p>

<p>Then I learnt something
of his eventful life.
He looked back on his
career very quietly&mdash;never
striving to make
"points," never yearning
for effect, though every
incident was in reality a
picture in itself. Imagine
the little fellow&mdash;deserted by his father at the
age of five&mdash;with the tiniest of prospects before
him of ever cultivating the gift which was
born with him when he first opened his eyes
in a little room in St. Peter's Street, Canterbury,
on September 26th, 1803.</p>

<p>The mother was left with five young children&mdash;at
the time of the long war&mdash;terrible days
for them. But the mother worked hard, and
her youngest boy never forgot it, as will be
seen later. He was christened Thomas, and
the name of Sidney was added some time
after&mdash;in this wise: The little fellow's great-uncle
was in the Navy, and had been at Acre
with Sir Sidney Smith, who had a great love
for Kent and its surroundings.</p>

<p>"Any news from Kent?" asked Sir
Sidney of his great-uncle one day.</p>

<p>"No, Admiral. Only Cooper's got another
boy."</p>

<p>"Indeed; then let him take my name!"</p>

<p>So "Sidney" was set down in the church
registry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span></p>

<p>"They never would call me 'Sidney,'"
said Mr. Cooper, as he remembered this;
"but when I commenced to draw on my
slate, at the age of eight, I always used to
put 'T.S.C.' in the corner. The very first
drawing I ever did was with a slate pencil,
of the Bell Tower of Canterbury Cathedral,
and one of my schoolfellows used to encourage
me by doing my sums for me, if I
would draw him a house with a bird on the
chimney.</p>

<p>"I was always in the fields&mdash;my heart was
in the green valleys and meadows. I loved
to sit by the
streams, and on
my Wednesday
and Saturday
half-holidays
from school I
would seek out
some nook and
draw horses and
dogs and sheep
on my slate. I
had no paper
and pencil. It
was not until I
was twelve or
thirteen that my
career really
commenced.
Then I started
to paint coaches
for Mr. Burgess,
of Canterbury,
at 12s. a week.
Every moment
I could spare I
was trying to
improve myself
in drawing but
even then I still
had to cling to
my slate and
pencil. But, I
got some lead pencils at last. Let me tell
you the story, and its sequel.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>BLACK PRINCE'S WELL.</p>

<p><i>From a Photo. by Elliott &amp; Fry.</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>"I was sketching the central tower of the
Cathedral. A gentleman was also drawing
another part of the sacred edifice. We met
often, without speaking. One day he came
up to me and asked me what I was doing.
I told him. He laughed merrily at the idea
of thus working on a slate, and some two or
three days afterwards he made me a present
of his bundle of pencils and paper. I could
scarcely contain myself. He patted me on
the head and went his way. But, I had no
knife! One day I saw a gentleman near the
Cathedral&mdash;a very solemn-looking gentleman
in clerical attire. I went up to him.</p>

<p>"'Please sir,' I said, 'have you a knife?'</p>

<p>"'Yes, my lad&mdash;what do you want it for?'</p>

<p>"I told him. And he sharpened all my
pencils for me&mdash;every one of the dozen.
Who was he? The Archbishop of Canterbury!"</p>

<p>Young Cooper was destined to discover
who it was that gave him his first pencils.
A pleasant little party was assembled in
London&mdash;Mr. Cooper was now well known&mdash;and
amongst those gathered at the board
were Stanfield,
Tom Landseer,
and George Cattermole.
They
were telling little
stories of the
early days, and
the cattle painter
related the incident
of the slate
and pencils.</p>

<p>Cattermole
jumped up.</p>

<p>"Why, Sidney,"
he cried,
"are you the
slate? <i>I am the
pencils!</i>"</p>

<p>"Then," continued
Mr.
Cooper, "came
my work at the
theatre. It was
one evening and
I was sketching&mdash;when
I heard
a cough behind
me. I turned
and saw a man
looking over me.</p>

<p>"'Ah!' he
exclaimed, 'you
draw well, my boy. You have a good eye&mdash;but
you must learn perspective.'</p>

<p>"'What is that, sir? I have never heard
of it before.'</p>

<p>"'Well,' he replied, 'it shows the proper
size of objects at a distance&mdash;how to draw a
street, a road, a distant hill or tree, etc. If
you like to call on me, I'll show you.'</p>

<p>"'Where do you live, please, sir?' I asked.</p>

<p>"'In Canterbury&mdash;at the theatre!' he
answered.</p>

<p>"'Oh! my mother wouldn't let me go to
the theatre!' I assured him.</p>

<p>"However, I went. I vividly remember
it. When I entered, there was the canvas
laid down on the stage for a Roman scene.
The actors were rehearsing on the space in
front. So Mr. Doyle&mdash;for that was the man's
name&mdash;instructed me in perspective, and I
learnt the artistic value of things that I had
long seen in Nature. The theatrical company
left&mdash;it used to go a sort of circuit to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
Canterbury, Faversham, Hastings, and Maidstone,
and when they came again next year
I helped him once more. I still continued
coach-painting&mdash;Mr. Burgess employing
me to do the rough work&mdash;rubbing down the
carriages, lying on my back underneath&mdash;grinding
colours, etc. When I was sixteen
the company returned. Poor Doyle died,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
and I was engaged as scene painter at a
guinea a week. So I went with them to
Faversham. I well remember my only
appearance as an actor. The piece to be
played was 'Macbeth,' and the scenery used
was some I had painted for 'Rob Roy.' The
manager told me I must play the part of
the bleeding Captain, and I wore a Scotch
dress&mdash;intended for <i>Norval</i>&mdash;which Mr.
Smollet, an actor, had given to me for
painting some imitation lace on a dark
dress he had. Well, I simply broke
down, and was positively conducted off the
stage. Buckstone played <i>Ross</i> in this
production. It was the first time I ever met
him. He was a dapper little fellow&mdash;very
lively and brimming over with fun. We
remained bosom friends to the day of his
death. When he got prosperous and
had married a second wife, every other
Sunday I used to go and dine with him.
He was just then beginning to get very
deaf.</p>

<p>"One night I said to him: 'Buck, I want
a private box.'</p>

<p>"'All right, Sidney, whenever you like.'</p>

<p>"'Next Tuesday, eh?'</p>

<p>"'All right, my boy&mdash;next Tuesday.'</p>

<p>"After dinner we were chatting, and I
said: 'Well, I've got my sketch-book with
me, and in return for the box I'll draw your
wife's portrait and the baby. It won't take a
quarter of an hour.' So they sat. I drew a
sheep and a lamb suckling."</p>

<div class="caption"><p>THE FLOCK MASTER'S HOPE.</p>

<p><i>From the Painting by T.S. Cooper, R.A.</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>Mr. Cooper's first work of importance was
founded on his first love. The Cathedral and
its precincts was one of the dearest spots on
earth to him, and he did some excellent
drawings on stone of the Cathedral and
Canterbury in general. The gateway of St.
Augustine's Monastery and High Street,
Canterbury, showing the coach waiting outside
the "George and Dragon," are good
examples of these&mdash;particularly the latter,
as it tends to show something of what the
Cathedral city was like when Mr. Cooper was
unconsciously stepping to fame with the aid of
a school slate and pencil. At last he got to
London and gained a studentship at the
Royal Academy, then held at Somerset
House. It filled his heart with hope&mdash;he
realized all his longings; but his uncle, who
had promised to support him while working
away at the Academy, suddenly threw him
over, and young Cooper was forced to go
back to Canterbury, and was obliged to paint
coaches once more and give lessons in drawing.
It was an important step when he,
together with his friend William Burgess,
decided to try the Continent. The young
artist was now twenty-four years of
age. He positively painted his way from
Calais to Brussels by doing likenesses of
the proprietors of small hostelries, together<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
with their families, in return for his board
and lodging.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>A BROOK IN THE MEADOWS.</p>

<p><i>From the Painting by T.S. Cooper, R.A.</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>"I got on very well in Brussels," said Mr.
Cooper, "giving lessons there, and began to
make money&mdash;indeed, I must have made
some five or six thousand francs a year after
I had been settled there some time. It was
at Brussels I met Verb&ouml;ckhoven, the great
animal painter, whose drawings of animals
were absolutely faultless. At that time I
was confining myself to old buildings, Gothic
architecture, picturesque bridges, etc., and
putting them on the stone. One day Verb&ouml;ckhoven
was looking at some of my pencil
drawings and said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'You could paint cattle.'</p>

<p>"I assured him I could not.</p>

<p>"'Oh, yes,' he said; 'here is a palette&mdash;try.'</p>

<p>"Some of his studies were tacked on the
wall, and I began to paint a black spotted
cow. Just at that moment a Miss Searle,
one of my pupils, came in accompanied by
her father, and Mr. Searle said to me:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'What! are you taking lessons?'</p>

<p>"'No,' I answered; 'Monsieur Verb&ouml;ckhoven
thinks I can paint, so I am copying
that cow.'</p>

<p>"'I wouldn't try another,' said Verb&ouml;ckhoven,
looking over, 'if they think you are taking
lessons I shall lose all my pupils! Never
mind&mdash;let it go&mdash;go in and win, Cooper!'</p>

<p>"Then came the terrible revolution of
1830. I was forced to return to England,
and I did so, in May, 1831, with a wife and
child, and &pound;13 in my pocket. I made my
way to London, and, fortunately for me,
Ackerman's, in the Strand, liked a bundle of
my drawings and purchased them at five
shillings apiece. Then the struggle
commenced. I had taken a second floor
in the Tottenham Court Road, and morning
after morning, with an orange and a couple
of Abernethy biscuits in my pocket, I
used to set out for Regent's Park, where
there were often from 500 to 1,000 cows
in those days, and try and sketch them.
My methods were simple. I always had six
or eight sketches going at one time, so
that if a cow moved from one position I
could go on with another, and only wait until
I caught my cattle friend in the old position.
At night I worked at home over my pipe,
and earned my daily bread by drawing them
on stone for Ackerman."</p>

<p>But success came at last&mdash;and through an
old fellow student, Caterson Smith, who
eventually became President of the Royal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
Academy of Dublin. Mr. Cooper had
painted a small canvas, 10in, by 8in., of a
cow and two sheep&mdash;he had done it when
it was too wet to go to Regent's Park.
Caterson Smith found him out and called on
him. He caught sight of this little group of
cattle.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>FARM IN EAST KENT.</p>

<p><i>From the Painting by T.S. Cooper, R.A.</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>"Look here, Cooper," he said, "I should
give up architectural stuff and stick to this.
I'll buy this picture. How much?"</p>

<p>"Oh, a few shillings," the young artist
replied.</p>

<p>"Two pounds?"</p>

<p>"Done."</p>

<p>So Caterson Smith purchased the Royal
Academician's first painting of cattle.</p>

<p>"Soon after this I began a larger one," said
Mr. Cooper. "I had removed to Windmill
Street to a <i>first floor</i>. The canvas was a
3ft. one. One morning
I was surprised
to have a visitor announced.
He came
up.</p>

<p>"'Your name is
Mr. Cooper?' he
said.</p>

<p>"'Yes, sir.'</p>

<p>"'I've seen a little
picture of yours, and
I was anxious to find
you out.'</p>

<p>"He found me
out in a strange
way," remarked Mr.
Cooper. "It seems
that Caterson Smith
had left the picture
he had purchased at
a frame-maker's in
Greek Street, Soho,
and the shopkeeper
liking it had put it
in his window. Here
my strange visitor
had seen it, and not
until Smith wrote for
the picture was he
able to discover me.</p>

<p>"'What's that you
are painting?' asked
the stranger, looking
at the 3ft. canvas on
the easel.</p>

<p>"'Oh! just some
cattle coming
through a stream,
sir.'</p>

<p>"'Very nice'&mdash;rubbing
his chin and eyeing it critically&mdash;'very
nice. How much?'</p>

<p>"'I hardly know.'</p>

<p>"'Well,' he said, 'if you will finish it
I will give you &pound;15 for it.'</p>

<p>"I agreed, and when he left he gave me
his card, and I saw his name was Cribb, and
that he lived at King Street, Covent Garden.</p>

<p>"I painted another for him. Then the
cholera broke out, and my wife, who was
far from well, wanted to go to the seaside
for a few days. Cribb had not paid me for
my second picture&mdash;I wanted the money, so
I called on him. He sat reading the paper
for one hour and a half by the clock in
Covent Garden Market, without speaking.</p>

<p>"I woke him up again with my request
to be paid.</p>

<p>"'Look here,' he said, suddenly, 'I don't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
think young men should have so much money
to run about with!'</p>

<p>"However, he paid me &pound;10 on account."</p>

<p>The estimable Mr. Cribb lost a trifle by
his meanness towards the great painter in
embryo. A Mr. Carpenter, a Bond Street
dealer, had found young Cooper out, and
gave him a commission to paint a picture for
&pound;30. It was exhibited in 1833, at the Suffolk Street
Gallery&mdash;and on the line&mdash;a half-length
picture of "A Kentish Farm." The
Press were most enthusiastic. "Here's a
new man," the critics said, "a new man who
will create a great school." The news sheets
were full of praise, and Mr. Cooper told me
how his wife and children made a scrap-book
by cutting out all the laudatory notices in the
papers and pasting them in. Young Cooper
went to the private view, and the keeper
came up to him and said that Mr. Vernon
wished to be introduced to him. Mr. Vernon&mdash;Robert
Vernon! He was one of the great
art patrons of the day; the kindest and most
liberal of men towards artists.</p>

<p>So they were introduced. He
wanted to buy the "Kentish Farm,"
but it was in the hands of a dealer,
who was asking a hundred guineas
for it; and Robert Vernon never
bought from dealers. However, Mr.
Vernon would call&mdash;he had his address
from the catalogue. The first
two men to shake hands with Sidney
Cooper on his success were
Stanfield and Roberts. Mr. Cooper
had now moved to St. John's Wood.
A few days passed by, when three
gentlemen called. One was Mr.
Vernon; the other Fawcett, the
comedian; and John Maddison
Moreton, who has made us cry with
laughter over his "Box and Cox."</p>

<p>"I sold Mr. Vernon," Mr. Cooper
said, continuing this delightful
narrative, "a little picture for &pound;15.
It was a group of cattle and a
woman with a donkey, the donkey
bearing baskets, in one of which
sat a child. That was my own
little girl&mdash;now the only survivor
of three daughters.</p>

<p>"Fawcett had been examining the
sketches in my room. Suddenly he
cried out:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Vernon, Vernon, look at this!'
It was a picture I had begun for the
Academy and one I called 'Tunford
Farm.'</p>

<p>"Vernon seemed delighted with it.</p>

<p>"'What's the price?' he asked, suddenly,
after a good look at it.</p>

<p>"'Well, sir,' I said, 'seeing that it is the
same size as that exhibited at Suffolk Street&mdash;&pound;30&mdash;I
had &pound;30 for that.'</p>

<p>"'Yes,' said Vernon, 'and the dealer asks
a hundred for it. I'll give you a hundred for
that on the easel&mdash;on condition that you
annul the purchase of this little &pound;15 picture!'</p>

<p>"'Tunford Farm' was exhibited in the
Royal Academy of 1834, and it now hangs
in the National Gallery as one of the Vernon
collection. That is sixty years ago, and I
have never missed a year since, and hope to
exhibit again this year."</p>

<div class="caption"><p>FIRST SKETCH FOR "THE MONARCH OF THE MEADOWS."</p>

<p>BY T.S. COOPER, R.A.</p></div>
</div>

<p>"Tunford Farm"&mdash;a subject which Mr.
Cooper has painted twice&mdash;created a great impression.
There was no cattle painter then,
and as Wilkie once remarked&mdash;and whenever
Wilkie used to dine at Mr. Vernon's he would
go up and look at the picture&mdash;"That's the
man to fill the gap." The picture was very
nearly turned out. It was chosen, but had
got put aside. The gallery was already hung,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
and one of the Hanging Committee,
Mr. Jones, R.A., positively
had his own picture
taken down and "Tunford
Farm" put up in its place.
This alone should tell of the
excellence of the work. From
that eventful day in '34 Mr.
Cooper has gone on year by
year substantiating his claim
to be regarded as the finest
painter of cattle this century
has seen. It would be impossible
to give a complete catalogue
of his many works, his
studies of cattle are countless.
One or two examples of his
genius are reproduced here&mdash;namely,
"The Flock Master's
Hope," "A Farm in East
Kent," "Tunford Farm"
(the second painting of the
picture which realized so
much for him), "The
Brook in the Meadows,"
and the original sketch for "The Monarch
of the Meadows," which was so mysteriously
stolen in September, 1881. No
artist has had his pictures more "counterfeited"
than Mr. Cooper. He was so
frequently asked to say if a picture was his
or not, that at last he was obliged to charge a
fee. According to Mr. Cooper's certificate
book, during the last few years he has had
241 so-called Cooper works submitted to
him, 219 out of which proved to be only
copies!</p>

<div class="caption"><p>THE SIDNEY COOPER SCHOOL OF ART AND BIRTHPLACE.</p>

<p><i>From a Photo. by Elliot &amp; Fry</i>.</p></div>
</div>

<p>I have referred in the early part of this
paper to the great love Mr. Cooper had for
his mother. When I said "Good-bye" to
him it was with a promise&mdash;very happily and
readily made&mdash;to stay for a moment at a
certain spot in St. Peter's Street, Canterbury.
There stands the Sidney Cooper School of
Art&mdash;a school Mr. Cooper founded in 1870,
giving gratuitous instruction to the students,
and subsequently presented to the City of
Canterbury in 1882.</p>

<p>"I wanted the youth of Canterbury to
have the shorthand of drawing&mdash;I had to find
it out myself," Mr. Cooper told me.</p>

<p>But there was another reason. At the
banquet given in honour of the Royal
Academician at his birthplace in October,
1870, Mr. Cooper rose and said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I had but one object&mdash;nay, I had two
objects&mdash;in erecting that Gallery of Art which
I have devoted to the inhabitants of my
native city and its neighbourhood. The one
was to dedicate it to her who fostered me in
my years of infancy and youth"&mdash;and at the
recollection of his mother, the great painter
was so overcome that he could not for some
time proceed with his remarks&mdash;"and I
determined to erect it on the very site of my
birthplace; and the other object was that
the youth of Canterbury who feel a desire for
the study of art may avail themselves of those
opportunities which were denied to me."</p>

<p>Half an hour after I left Sidney Cooper I
was watching the students at work and carrying
out the wishes of the thoughtful founder of
this excellent institution. But, I must confess
to staying longer outside than I did inside.
Next door to the school is a quaint old
gabled house, striking in all its picturesqueness,
and even a stranger would not pass it by without
turning to look at it. How much more
interesting it becomes when you know that
the old-fashioned latticed window on the first
floor opens into the room where a certain
little fellow first saw the light ninety years
ago, and that on the very stone step which
leads to the door that same little fellow, a
few years later, used to sit with his slate and
pencil. Thomas Sidney Cooper, R.A., told
me so; and he, above all others, ought to
know.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">In</span> the City of Brussels a great
deal of very pretty lace is exposed
for sale. Englishwomen
admire this lace and buy it.
If they go straight from Belgium
to England they can take
it home without having to pay any duty; but
if they pass through France they have to pay
on all their new Brussels lace at the French
Custom House. And many Englishwomen pass
through France on their way from Belgium to
England, because they prefer the short passage
from Calais to Dover to the longer one from
Ostend.</p>

<p>The Misses Wylie were charming, middle-aged
ladies, fond of travel, fond of dress, fond
of lace, and very bad sailors. They had
been excursioning in Germany, had come
down the Rhine, and had spent a week in
Brussels. More attractive than the Field of
Waterloo, and more fascinating than the
<i>Mus&eacute;e Wiertz</i>, was the <i>Galerie St. Hubert</i>.
Miss Melissa Wylie could not resist the white
Brussels lace; Miss Annora Wylie could not
resist the black. Each of the ladies bought
lace; led on by the tempter, in the shape
of a seductive shopwoman, the Misses Wylie
bought lace <i>fichus</i>, lace collarettes, lace by
the m&egrave;tre. Day by day they added to their
stock.</p>

<p>At length it was necessary to make for
England, and to pass through that dreadful
France with its protective duties. Then
they realized their position; how about the
lace?</p>

<p>"We cannot conscientiously say," remarked
Miss Melissa, "that we have <i>rien &agrave; d&eacute;clarer</i>,
because this lace is dutiable."</p>

<p>"And we dare not risk packing it," returned
Miss Annora, "because they might
take it into their heads to examine our
boxes."</p>

<p>"How can we get it through?" mused the
elder sister.</p>

<p>"We must get it through!" declared the
younger sister.</p>

<p>Presently Annora exclaimed, "I have it!
We will wear it! No duty is paid on what
one is wearing."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," said Melissa, "but how can
we wear it? The white will get soiled and
the black torn in travelling. Besides, if it
looks unnatural, as it would on our dresses
and mantles, the officials will be sure to
notice it."</p>

<p>"It would not look unnatural on our
bonnets," said Annora.</p>

<p>They set to work to decorate their bonnets
with the lace. They mingled white and black,
<i>fichu</i> and flounce, in the most skilful manner,
and though the bonnets looked somewhat overdone,
yet they carried the lace, and it was probable
that the male eyes of the Custom House
officials would not notice anything abnormal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span></p>

<p>The Misses Wylie rejoiced in their cleverness.
They sat in the train on their way to
France with clear consciences and light
hearts. They had <i>rien &agrave; d&eacute;clarer</i>, nothing
dutiable. In the compartment with them
was only one other passenger, a stout man of
good-humoured aspect; evidently, from his
extreme flabby stoutness and his extreme
good-humour, a middle-class German. Now,
Germans who understand English are very
sociable with their English fellow-travellers.
As this German did not address the Misses
Wylie, they felt sure that he did not understand
English, and they talked freely to
each other.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 544px;">
<img src="images/i_243.jpg" width="544" height="531" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"THEY TALKED FREELY."</p></div>
</div>

<p>"I suppose," said Melissa, "that my
bonnet looks all right? It does not strike the
eyes as being too much trimmed, eh, Annora?"</p>

<p>"Well," said Annora, laughing, "it is too
much trimmed for good taste, but then on
this occasion you have bad taste. What
about mine?"</p>

<p>"Oh, quite artistic; 'a study in black and
white,' as the artists say."</p>

<p>The ladies laughed together, full of glee
at their coming triumph over the Custom
House officers. The German wore the
fatuous grin affected by people who listen
to a language which they do not understand.</p>

<p>At last the train slowed into Blandain
Station, the frontier! Out jumped the
Misses Wylie with their hand baggage.
They calmly awaited the approach of the
officers. Out lumbered the German with
his fatuous smile. He sauntered up to one
of the chiefs of the <i>douane</i>.</p>

<p>"Rien &agrave; d&eacute;clarer," said both ladies.</p>

<p>"Eau de Cologne, dentelles, tabac,
spiritueux&mdash;" the officer ran off.</p>

<p>"Rien, rien," said the Misses Wylie.</p>

<p>The man said nothing more, and the
ladies, expecting the cry of "En voiture, s'il
vous pla&icirc;t!" felt extremely happy.</p>

<p>But at that moment
the official to whom the
German had been speaking
came up to them
and said, in very fair
English, "The ladies
are fond of lace?"</p>

<p>Their hearts sank
within them. "Rather,"
they conceded.</p>

<p>"And to carry it on
the bonnet is a convenient
manner of avoiding
the duty."</p>

<p>They were undone!</p>

<p>"But we are wearing
it!" screeched Annora;
Melissa panted.</p>

<p>"Mesdames, I admire
your ingenuity,
but such an amount of
new lace cannot be
passed, even on your
bonnets. Two, three,
five m&egrave;tres," he went
on, measuring the unlucky
lace with his eye,
"<i>fichu</i>, flounce, and so
forth; so many francs,
or I confiscate it."</p>

<p>"En voiture, s'il
vous pla&icirc;t!" was heard.</p>

<p>The sum demanded by the officer, added
to what they had paid in purchase, would
have made the lace the dearest that ever was
bought. They tore off their bonnets, pulled
out innumerable pins, set free the <i>fichus</i>,
flounces, etc., put them into the officer's
hands, and ran to their seats. Out of breath
and out of pocket, they were most unhappy.
Successful cheating is one thing; but unsuccessful
cheating is another, and causes
sharp pangs of conscience.</p>

<p>"Too bad!" cried Melissa, as the train
moved on; "we were entitled to what we wore."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span></p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 544px;">
<img src="images/i_244.jpg" width="544" height="506" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"'WE ARE WEARING IT!' SCREECHED ANNORA."</p></div>
</div>

<p>"It was that German," said Annora. "He
understood English; he heard what we said;
he told the official. Oh, a man may grin,
and grin, and be a villain!"</p>

<p>They groaned over their misfortune. The
first time the train stopped the villain
entered their compartment, still grinning.
They glared at him, but he still grinned.
They took refuge in silence; he began to
speak.</p>

<p>"Ladies," he said in Londonese English,
"I was very sorry to have to incur your
displeasure, but I felt that it was my duty to
report you at the <i>douane</i>. You had innocently
told me all about the lace on your bonnets,
and for the credit of our country, for the sake
of English honesty, I was constrained to
point out your bonnets to that official. Can
you forgive me?"</p>

<p>"No," said Annora.</p>

<p>But Melissa thought that, notwithstanding
his wicked cruelty, there was something very
pleasant in his smile.</p>

<p>"I entreat your forgiveness, ladies; more,
I humbly ask a favour."</p>

<p>"Sir?" exclaimed Annora.</p>

<p>"Miss Wylie, Miss Annora Wylie"&mdash;the
presuming wretch had seen their names
on their luggage, even their Christian names&mdash;"you
will confer a
great favour on me if
you will tell me your
address."</p>

<p>Annora reddened,
Melissa blushed. Perhaps
he was ashamed
of the cruel part he had
played and was about
to offer an apology;
perhaps their brave
and gentle endurance
of misfortune had
touched him; perhaps
their charms had so
won upon him that he
wished to see more of
them, with a view to&mdash;their
suppositions
broke off abruptly.</p>

<p>Annora looked at
Melissa, and Melissa
looked at Annora.
Then the elder sister
spoke. "We live at
113, Angelina Gardens,
Edwin Square, South
Kensington, S.W."</p>

<p>The stranger made a
note of the address.
Melissa was on the point of asking his name,
when he said abruptly, "You shall hear from
me." Then he discoursed on the country
through which they were passing; after which
he buried himself in a <i>Figaro</i> and talked no
more. At the next stoppage he said a brusque
"Good morning, ladies," and left the compartment,
and they saw no more of him.</p>

<p>There was a considerable flutter in the
breast of Melissa, who was of a romantic
turn of mind, and who could only imagine
one reason why this stranger should want her
address. She still believed that he was a
German who spoke English remarkably well,
and she had seen that he was not a gentleman;
she therefore made up her mind to
refuse the offer of marriage which, no doubt,
he would shortly make.</p>

<p>Arrived in Angelina Gardens, the Misses
Wylie were occupied in arranging the household,
and a couple of busy days were spent
by them. On the third day after their
home-coming they received, by the same
post, a parcel and a letter. Annora opened
the carefully tied and sealed parcel, while
Melissa read the letter. Having read it once to
herself, she next read it aloud to her sister:</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Mesdames</span>,&mdash;I felt myself under a very
great obligation to you the other day at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
Blandain. I am a very thin man, but I was
swathed round with hundreds of yards of
fine Brussels lace, and I thought that the
best way of drawing the attention of the
Custom House officers from myself was to
draw it to you. It was purely in self-defence
that I directed the raid on your bonnets.
Having been the cause of the loss of your
lace, I wish to make you due compensation,
and I beg leave to send you some finer lace
than that which you lost.</p>

<p class="center">"I am, obediently yours,
"<span class="smcap">Your Stout Fellow-Traveller.</span>"

<img src="images/i_245a.jpg" width="566" height="485" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"YOU SHALL HEAR FROM ME."</p></div>
</div>

<p>Melissa took possession of a black lace
flounce, and Annora of a dozen yards of
white lace and a lace-edged handkerchief,
and they quite forgave the stout German for
his cruelty and for his stoutness.</p>

<h3>XXI.&mdash;ZIG-ZAG SCANSORIAL.</h3>

<p>Now, a "scansorial zig-zag" may be
interpreted to mean a graded path up
a cliff&mdash;does mean it, in fact, if you
like to use the phrase in that sense. I
don't. Scansores are climbing
birds&mdash;toucans, parrots,
parrakeets, cockatoos,
macaws, lories, and
woodpeckers. In the house
numbered 54 and 55 on the
plan of the Gardens (having
two numbers for no particular
reason except that one
would be quite enough),
all these birds are
represented except<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
the woodpecker. The woodpecker
is also excluded from
this zig-zag for similar reasons,
which I can't remember at this
moment. One may be the
fact of the woodpecker tapping,
whereas all taps is vanities.</p>

<p>A toucan is a beak, fitted
with an inadequate bird at
the hinder end. It is over
against the wall, opposite
the front door of 54 and 55,
that one recognises the fine
Roman nose of the toucan.
A green nose, a red nose,
a yellow nose, a black nose, all these
colours you may see, but all nobly
Roman as to shape. The toucan
will not talk in the manner of the
parrot, but he (or she) is an admirable
listener. I have told the green-billed
toucan many stories of bird-scandal
without interruption, and, on the
whole, the conversation has been
most improving. "Dear, dear!"&mdash;"Really,
now"&mdash;"Who'd have
thought it?"&mdash;"No&mdash;o&mdash;o&mdash;o! You
don't really say so? Well, you do
surprise me!" These are the only
contributions offered to the talk by
the green-billed toucan, and even
these are only in pantomime. An
ideal listener, the toucan. I have a
horrible temptation to say that toucan
play at that game, and that if you
are anxious not to be toucandid, you
toucan say nothing, and the bird will
listen just as respectfully; but a
pious bringing-up enables me to
cast the temptation from
me&mdash;toucancel the inclination, in fact.
Howbeit, the truth remains that
the toucan will listen with perfect
attention whether you proffer
information aloud or get no further
than inventing it.</p>

<p>The toucan will chatter horribly
in native freedom, but that is
only when many hundreds of
other toucans are present to
keep it in countenance; for
the toucan's voice is not
pretty, and he knows it. Still,
when hundreds assemble,
every one with a discordant
voice, nothing is more natural
than that they should all shout
at once, and unite in the belief
that the performance is admirable.
If there were
any ugly women (there are
not, of course&mdash;it is a
mere hypothesis), and they
were all collected together
to the number of many
hundreds on a solitary
island, the first thing they
would do would be to hold a
beauty show with a prize for
everybody, and next they would
fight over the distribution of
those prizes. The toucans do
something very much like
this&mdash;minus the fighting, because
the prize is mutual admiration.
They chatter and scream in
their hundreds&mdash;taking care to
leave a sentinel on guard,
because other animals won't
stand anything, even in South
America&mdash;and at intervals
they all join in a simultaneous
yell of approbation,
audible half a league
off. The whole performance
is a sad piece
of humbug, which makes
one marvel greatly that
because of it the South
American natives call the
toucan the Preacher-bird.
Here, with so many gorgeous
parrots and macaws about, the
toucan behaves with becoming
modesty, but in the presence
of any duller-clad bird than
itself its arrogance is frightful.
A great crowd of toucans will
mob any such unfortunate
creature with much chatter,
till, surrounded by long
and threatening bills, like
a despairing debtor, he
"hops the twig"&mdash;if he
can.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most dissipated-looking
creature in the animal kingdom
is a toucan during a bad
moult. You long to give
him a gallon of soda-water
and a temperance
tract. He sleeps much
(a toucan always sleeps
with his beak over his
shoulder and covered by
his wing&mdash;he doesn't
mean to have that nose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
stolen)&mdash;he sleeps as much as
possible, and wakes as seedy as
one can imagine. He can
scarcely drag his beak
off his back without
banging it on his
perch, and considers
the question of breakfast
with a shudder. With
many blinks he strives
desperately to pull himself
together&mdash;to pull
together a handful of
loose quills and a
beak. They give
him grapes; it is
a mockery. Who can
eat grapes with such
a head? He may
struggle with a grape
perhaps for a few
seconds, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
breakfast beats him in the end, and he retires to a
repentant corner. What a night it must have been!</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 363px;">
<img src="images/i_249b.jpg" width="363" height="290" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>A LITTLE HORSEY</p></div>
</div>

<p>Out of his moult, however, and in good feather,
the toucan is rather a fine bird, so long as you
forget his nose. The Ariel toucan here&mdash;with
the black beak&mdash;is a little horsey in
aspect&mdash;a very little&mdash;but quite neat
and gentlemanly. Not such a real
old crusted Tory-club-window gentleman
as the Triton cockatoo, but
still a gentleman. As for the green-billed
toucan, she can never be
anything but a good-natured Jewess
in her most gorgeous
Shabbos clothes.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>"VELL RACHAEL!"</p></div>
</div>

<p>The comparative quietness
of the toucans in house
number 54-55 is, probably,
due to a worse thing&mdash;the
noise of the parrots and
cockatoos; the house can
hold no more noise, and
the toucans altogether despair
of ever making themselves
heard. Why the
windows are so rarely broken
I can scarcely understand,
except on the hypothesis of
a suspension of natural laws
for the benefit of natural
science and its institutions.
The keeper says he doesn't
mind the noise&mdash;to such
torture may human nature
be accommodated by long
habit. Saint Cecilia would
have become accustomed to
boiling if she had had forty
years of it. The other
saint (male, but I forget
which) who was grilled could
never have done without
his hot gridiron if he had
been able to keep on it for
forty years, the time this
keeper has been among
these parrots. Personally,
I should expect to become
reconciled to boiling, grilling,
or any other class of
plain cookery, in about half
the time that would elapse
before a few hundred competitive
parrot-yells began
to feel soothing to the
nerves.</p>

<p>There is no other house
in these Gardens where the
unobtrusive visitor is so
made to feel his utter smallness
and insignificance&mdash;and
that by mere brazen
clamour&mdash;as in this. The
elephants look large&mdash;they
<i>are</i> large&mdash;but the elephants
behave with gentlemanly
quietness and self-respect.
The parrots rise up and
curse you (and everything else) with sudden
and painful unanimity. You are appalled,
dwarfed, made insignificant and ashamed by
the overpowering vastness of&mdash;the mere row.</p>

<p>The fact is that each single individual of this
crowd of parrots, cockatoos, macaws, and parrakeets
holds his own importance above every
other created thing as a prime article of belief, and is
naturally and most virtuously indignant when he finds
that you don't go directly to him and load him with
presents. Therefore, he blares and screams at you,
till the air swims in your ears and eyes and the outer
world is but a chaos of great beaks, angry combs, and
streaks of red, green, and white. If you venture so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
far as to make an invidious selection, and tender a peace-offering
to a particular bird, you draw down upon your
devoted head the double rage and united jealousy of all
the other parrots, cockatoos, parrakeets, and macaws, each
convinced that you couldn't
possibly have seen <i>him</i> or
you would never have
slighted so superlative a
creature; and again
the air and the
colours swim to your
senses. The whole
sensation is not unlike
that produced
by a long inspection
of immense thundering
and shrieking engineering
works. You feel bewildered
and you feel small:
and everything about you
is metallic and mechanical.
Every movement of a parrot,
if you will but notice it, is suggestive
of metal joints and mechanical action;
and the voice&mdash;but there is no metal
metallic enough to emit such a voice as
that at its worst.</p>

<p>There is a married couple here&mdash;Triton
cockatoos&mdash;near the keeper's
room. They nag and quarrel and
snarl at one another, and all on
strictly mechanical principles. Their
only gibe is an inarticulate snarl
delivered when repartee seems
unlikely. Thus, Mr. C. observing
Mrs. C. apparently
asleep will snarl ferociously,
and compose himself to rest.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
In a little while Mrs. C. will rouse herself, and perceiving
the placid quiescence of Mr. C., will snarl
at him and go to sleep again: all this with a
mechanic jerk of the head and neck suggestive of
Punch or an automaton. After a while, perhaps,
the inclination for a snarl will take both at once,
and, finding themselves face to face, with
nothing original to say, they will subside
and sulk for the rest of the day, each
trying hard to think of some particularly
unkind remark to hurl at the other.</p>

<p>Cocky, the big Triton, has been moved
here from the insect-house, and shows
signs of forgetting his English. That is
what will occur in a congregation of this
sort. The marvel is that many of the
birds will still talk at all. An old, rose-crested
cockatoo will dance gracefully,
with his head on one side (and his eye
on the reward), at the offer of a nut. He
is called Cocky, in common with all of
his kind, just as the parrot is always
Polly; but I prefer to call him Richardson,
because his is, practically speaking,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
the only show in the fair. There is a slender-billed
cockatoo, who offers me a warlike challenge to
"come on" whenever I approach him, and a few
more who have a word or two, but Richardson is
the only bird capable of a decent show. He will
stand at his cage wires and bawl out "What ho!
what ho! what ho!" in a way that confirms his
classification as a showman and gives a hint of
aspirations to tragedy. Richardson is the least
mechanical of the birds here, and is a most
respectable and old-fashioned veteran, who would
look quite in character taking snuff, and whose
polite accomplishments have not been ruined by
his residence among unmannered crowds of other birds.</p>

<p>But, mannered or not, here is nothing but a crowd of
screaming, unfeeling, snapping painted machines. I have
never seen a plucked parrot, but I know,
without seeing, that you have only to
pluck one to lay bare nuts and bolts,
cams, hinges, springs, cranks, and metallic
joints. See a cockatoo spread and shut
his crest: clearly it is just the motion that
could be actuated by a string on the
wooden harlequin principle: probably, as
there is no string, there is a long spiral
spring under the feathers of the head (just
lying along where some people part their
hair) set going by a catch on the principle
of the air-gun trigger. As to the gorgeous
mechanisms on perches that hang in a line down the
main aisle, every joint, sound, and motion spells "clockwork"
aloud. Such of these as speak have one word,
which is "Hullo!" This, in varying degrees of urgency
and gruffness, will greet you as you pass along the line&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>if
you show any
indication of
nuts; otherwise
you are insignificant,
and unworthy
of notice.
One fine blue
and yellow machine will not
say "Hullo" without receiving a nut
in advance; probably being constructed
on the familiar automatic
principle. But it is
all an expressionless
outcome of clockwork.</p>

<p>We seldom see
among the lists of
"patents sealed"
and "provisional
protections"
granted, any reference
to an invention for
improvements in the mechanism of parrots
and cockatoos. It is a remarkable thing
that so obvious a field for
invention and
improvement
should have
been so much
neglected.
Plainly, an easy
and obvious improvement
would be the provision
of a simple shut-off valve, by which
the suffering proprietor could stop
the parrot's steam whistle when
desired. The desirability of some
such improvement need not be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
enlarged upon, and, once the appliance
were in the market, every
parrot-owner would hasten to have it
fitted to his machine.
Another contrivance,
having the same object,
would consist of a
self-acting escape
valve, by which the
familiar scream of the
mechanism would
be diverted, and escape
noiselessly through a
small grating at the
back of the neck after
a certain degree of pressure
had been attained.
Moreover, what more
easy than to have the
outer side of the jaw-hinge
fitted with a convenient
butterfly-nut,
by tightening which,
after the periodical
stoking with maize and
so forth, the engine
would be prevented
from nipping carelessly-offered
fingers? As
it is at present, the
jaw-hinge is a mere
ordinary pair of sharp
pincers barbarically
ornamented with
feathers and colours.
Improvements suggest
themselves at every
point. Many of these
otherwise amusing instruments
cause trouble
by occasionally breaking
out into startling
and exceedingly forcible
language. It
would seem that a
pressure valve might
be profitably employed
in this case also, by
means of which, as
soon as the expressions
reached to the degree
of "blow it," or "shut
up," the power would
be immediately diverted,
and either
allowed to escape
harmlessly through a
small chimney at the
top of the head, or
else conducted by a
power-transmitting
mechanism to an
adjacent musical-box,
which would play
"Pop Goes the Weasel,"
or something else
of a similarly moral
tendency. The whole
subject is full of profitable
suggestions,
which are offered, free
of any expense beyond
a small royalty to myself,
to the notice of
persons of mechanical
genius.</p>

<h3>IX. AN OAK COFFIN.</h3>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_255.png" width="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">On</span> a certain cold morning in early
spring, I was visited by two
ladies, mother and daughter.
The mother was dressed as a
widow. She was a tall, striking-looking
woman, with full,
wide-open dark eyes, and a mass of rich hair
turned back from a white and noble brow.
Her lips were firm, her features well formed.
She seemed to have plenty of character, but
the deep lines of sadness under her eyes and
round her lips were very remarkable. The
daughter was a girl of fourteen, slim to weediness.
Her eyes were dark, like her mother's,
and she had an abundance of tawny brown
and very handsome hair. It hung down her
back below her waist, and floated over her
shoulders. She was dressed, like her mother,
in heavy mourning, and round her young
mouth and dark, deep eyes there lingered
the same inexpressible sadness.</p>

<p>I motioned my visitors to chairs, and
waited as usual to learn the reason of their
favouring me with a call.</p>

<p>"My name is Heathcote," said the elder
lady. "I have lately lost my husband. I
have come to you on account of my
daughter&mdash;she is not well."</p>

<p>I glanced again more attentively at the
young girl. I saw that she looked overstrained
and nervous. Her restlessness, too,
was so apparent that she could scarcely sit
still, and catching up a paper-knife which
stood on the table near, she began twirling it
rapidly between her finger and thumb.</p>

<p>"It does me good to fidget with something,"
she said, glancing apologetically at
her mother.</p>

<p>"What are your daughter's symptoms?" I
asked.</p>

<p>Mrs. Heathcote began to describe them in
the vague way which characterizes a certain
class of patient. I gathered at last from her
words that Gabrielle would not eat&mdash;she slept
badly&mdash;she was weak and depressed&mdash;she took
no interest in anything.</p>

<p>"How old is Miss Gabrielle?" I asked.</p>

<p>"She will be fifteen her next birthday,"
replied her mother.</p>

<p>All the while Mrs. Heathcote was speaking,
the young daughter kept her eyes fixed on
the carpet&mdash;she still twirled the paper-knife,
and once or twice she yawned profoundly.</p>

<p>I asked her to prepare for the usual
medical examination. She complied without
any alacrity, and with a look on her face which
said plainly, "Young as I am, I know how
useless all this fuss is&mdash;I only submit because
I must."</p>

<p>I felt her pulse and sounded her heart and
lungs. The action of the heart was a little
weak, but the lungs were perfectly healthy. In
short, beyond a general physical and mental
debility, I could find nothing whatever the
matter with the girl.</p>

<p>After a time, I rang the bell to desire my
servant to take Miss Heathcote into another
room, in order that I might speak to her
mother alone.</p>

<p>The young lady went away very unwillingly.
The sceptical expression on her face was
more apparent than ever.</p>

<p>"You will be sure to tell me the exact
truth?" said Mrs. Heathcote, as soon as
we were alone.</p>

<p>"I have very little to tell," I replied. "I
have examined your daughter carefully. She
is suffering from no disease to which a name
can be attached. She is below par, certainly;
there is weakness and general depression,
but a tonic ought to set all these matters
right."</p>

<p>"I have tried tonics without avail," said
Mrs. Heathcote.</p>

<p>"Has not your family physician seen Miss
Heathcote?"</p>

<p>"Not lately." The widow's manner became
decidedly hesitating. "The fact is, we
have not consulted him since&mdash;since Mr.
Heathcote's death," she said.</p>

<p>"When did that take place?"</p>

<p>"Six months ago."</p>

<p>Here she spoke with infinite sadness, and
her face, already very pale, turned perceptibly
paler.</p>

<p>"Is there nothing you can tell me to give
me a clue to your daughter's condition? Is
there anything, for instance, preying on her
mind?"</p>

<p>"Nothing whatever."</p>

<p>"The expression of her face is very sad for
so young a girl."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span></p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 543px;">
<img src="images/i_256.jpg" width="543" height="607" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"I FELT HER PULSE."</p></div>
</div>

<p>"You must remember," said Mrs.
Heathcote, "that she has lately lost her
father."</p>

<p>"Even so," I replied; "that would scarcely
account for her nervous condition. A
healthy-minded child will not be overcome
with grief to the serious detriment of health
after an interval of six months. At least," I
added, "that is my experience in ordinary
cases."</p>

<p>"I am grieved to hear it," said Mrs.
Heathcote.</p>

<p>She looked very much troubled. Her
agitation was apparent in her trembling hands
and quivering lips.</p>

<p>"Your daughter is in a nervous condition,"
I said, rising. "She has no disease at
present, but a little extra strain might develop
real disease, or might affect her nerves,
already overstrung, to a dangerous degree.
I should recommend complete change of air
and scene immediately."</p>

<p>Mrs. Heathcote sighed heavily.</p>

<p>"You don't look very well yourself," I
said, giving her a keen glance.</p>

<p>She flushed crimson.</p>

<p>"I have felt my
sorrow acutely," she
replied.</p>

<p>I made a few more
general remarks, wrote
a prescription for the
daughter, and bade Mrs.
Heathcote good-bye.
About the same hour
on the following morning
I was astonished
when my servant brought
me a card on which was
scribbled in pencil the
name <i>Gabrielle Heathcote</i>,
and underneath, in
the same upright, but
unformed hand, the
words, "I want to see
you most urgently."</p>

<p>A few moments later,
Miss Gabrielle was
standing in my consulting-room.
Her appearance
was much the
same as yesterday, except
that now her face was
eager, watchful, and all
awake.</p>

<p>"How do you do?"
she said, holding out
her hand, and blushing.
"I have ventured to
come alone, and I haven't brought a fee.
Does that matter?"</p>

<p>"Not in the least," I replied. "Pray sit
down and tell me what you want."</p>

<p>"I would rather stand," she answered; "I
feel too restless and excited to sit still. I
stole away from home without letting mother
know. I liked your look yesterday and
determined to see you again. Now, may I
confide in you?"</p>

<p>"You certainly may," I replied.</p>

<p>My interest in this queer child was a good
deal aroused. I felt certain that I was right
in my conjectures of yesterday, and that this
young creature was really burdened with
some secret which was gravely undermining
her health.</p>

<p>"I am willing to listen to you," I continued.
"You must be brief, of course, for I am a
very busy man, but anything you can say
which will throw light on your own condition,
and so help me to cure you, will, of course,
be welcome."</p>

<p>"You think me very nervous?" said Miss
Gabrielle.</p>

<p>"Your nerves are out of order," I replied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span></p>

<p>"You know that I don't sleep at night?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Miss Gabrielle looked towards the door.</p>

<p>"Is it shut?" she asked, excitedly.</p>

<p>"Of course it is."</p>

<p>She came close to me, her voice dropped
to a hoarse whisper, her face turned not only
white but grey.</p>

<p>"I can stand it no longer," she said. "I'll
tell you the truth. You wouldn't sleep either
if you were me. <i>My father isn't dead!</i>"</p>

<p>"Nonsense," I replied. "You must control
such imaginings, Miss Gabrielle, or you
will really get into a very unhealthy condition
of mind."</p>

<p>"That's what mother says when I speak to
her," replied the child. "But I tell you, this
thing is true. My father is not dead. I
know it."</p>

<p>"How can you possibly know it?" I
asked.</p>

<p>"I have seen him&mdash;there!"</p>

<p>"You have seen your father!&mdash;but he died
six months ago?"</p>

<p>"Yes. He died&mdash;and was buried, and I
went to his funeral. But all the same he is
not dead now."</p>

<p>"My dear young lady," I said, in as soothing
a tone as I could assume, "you are the
victim of what is called a hallucination.
You have felt your father's death very
acutely."</p>

<p>"I have. I loved him beyond words.
He was so kind, so affectionate, so good to
me. It almost broke my heart when he died.
I thought I could never be happy again.
Mother was as wretched as myself. There
weren't two more miserable people in the
wide world. It seemed impossible to either
of us to smile or be cheerful again. I began
to sleep badly, for I cried so much, and my
eyes ached, and I did not care for lessons
any more."</p>

<p>"All these feelings will pass," I replied;
"they are natural, but time will abate their
violence."</p>

<p>"You think so?" said the girl, with a
strange smile. "Now let me go on with
my story: It was at Christmas time I first
saw my father. We live in an old house at
Brixton. It has a walled-in garden. I was
standing by my window about midnight. I
had been in bed for an hour or more, but I
could not sleep. The house was perfectly
quiet. I got out of bed and went to the
window and drew up the blind. I stood by
the window and looked out into the garden,
which was covered with snow. There, standing
under the window, with his arms folded,
was father. He stood perfectly still, and
turned his head slowly, first in the direction
of my room and then in that of
mother's. He stood there for quite five
minutes, and then walked across the
grass into the shelter of the shrubbery. I
put a cloak on and rushed downstairs. I
unbolted the front door and went into the
garden. I shouted my father's name and
ran into the shrubbery to look for him, but
he wasn't there, and I&mdash;I think I fainted.
When I came to myself I was in bed and
mother was bending over me. Her face was
all blistered as if she had been crying terribly.
I told her that I had just seen father, and
she said it was a dream."</p>

<p>"So it was," I replied.</p>

<p>Miss Gabrielle's dark brows were knit in
some pain.</p>

<p>"I did not think you would take that
commonplace view," she responded.</p>

<p>"I am sorry I have offended you," I
answered. "Girls like you do have bad
dreams when they are in trouble, and those
dreams are often so vivid, that they mistake
them for realities."</p>

<p>"Very well, then, I have had more of those
vivid dreams. I have seen my father again.
The last time I saw him he was in the house.
It was about a month ago. As usual, I could
not sleep, and I went downstairs quite late to
get the second volume of a novel which
interested me. There was father walking
across the passage. His back was to me.
He opened the study door and went in. He
shut it behind him. I rushed to it in order
to open it and follow him. It was locked,
and though I screamed through the key-hole,
no one replied to me. Mother found me
kneeling by the study door and shouting
through the key-hole to father. She was up
and dressed, which seemed strange at so late
an hour. She took me upstairs and put me
to bed, and pretended to be angry with me,
but when I told her that I had seen father
she burst into the most awful bitter tears and
said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Oh, Gabrielle, he is dead&mdash;dead&mdash;quite
dead!'</p>

<p>"'Then he comes here from the dead,' I
said. 'No, he is not dead. I have just
seen him.'</p>

<p>"'My poor child,' said mother, 'I must
take you to a good doctor without delay.
You must not get this thing on your brain.'</p>

<p>"'Very well,' I replied; 'I am quite
willing to see Dr. Mackenzie.'"</p>

<p>I interrupted the narrative to inquire who
Dr. Mackenzie was.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span></p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 473px;">
<img src="images/i_258.jpg" width="473" height="592" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"I SCREAMED THROUGH THE KEY-HOLE."</p></div>
</div>

<p>"He is our family physician," replied the
young lady. "He has attended us for
years."</p>

<p>"And what did your mother say when you
proposed to see him?"</p>

<p>"She shivered violently, and said, 'No,
I won't have him in the house.' After a
time she decided to bring me to you."</p>

<p>"And have you had that hallucination
again?" I inquired.</p>

<p>"It was not a hallucination," she answered,
pouting her lips.</p>

<p>"I will humour you," I answered. "Have
you seen your father again?"</p>

<p>"No, and I am not likely to."</p>

<p>"Why do you think that?"</p>

<p>"I cannot quite tell you&mdash;I think mother
is in it. Mother is very unhappy about
something, and she looks at me at times
as if she were afraid of me." Here Miss
Heathcote rose. "You said I was not to stay
long," she remarked. "Now I have told you
everything. You see that it is absolutely
impossible for ordinary medicines to cure me,
any more than ordinary medicines can cure
mother of her awful dreams."</p>

<p>"I did not know that your
mother dreamt badly," I said.</p>

<p>"She does&mdash;but she doesn't
wish it spoken of. She dreams
so badly, she cries out so
terribly in her sleep, that she
has moved from her old bedroom
next to mine, to one in
a distant wing of the house.
Poor mother, I am sorry for
her, but I am glad at least
that I have had courage to tell
you what I have seen. You
will make it your business to
find out the truth now, won't
you?"</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" I
asked.</p>

<p>"Why, of course, my father
is alive," she retorted. "You
have got to prove that he is,
and to give him back to me
again. I leave the matter in
your hands. I know you are
wise and very clever. Good-bye,
good-bye!"</p>

<p>The queer girl left me, tears
rolling down her cheeks. I was
obliged to attend to other
patients, but it was impossible
for me to get Miss Heathcote's
story out of my head. There
was no doubt whatever that she
was telling me what she firmly believed to be
the truth. She had either seen her father once
more in the flesh, or she was the victim of
a very strong hallucination. In all probability
the latter supposition was the correct
one. A man could not die and have a
funeral and yet still be alive: but, then,
on the other hand, when Mrs. Heathcote
brought Gabrielle to see me yesterday, why
had she not mentioned this central and
principal feature of her malady? Mrs.
Heathcote had said nothing whatever with
regard to Gabrielle's delusions. Then why
was the mother so nervous? Why did she
say nothing about her own bad dreams,
dreams so disturbing, that she was obliged
to change her bedroom in order that her
daughter should not hear her scream?</p>

<p>"I leave the matter in your hands!" Miss
Heathcote had said. Poor child, she had
done so with a vengeance. I could not get
the story out of my thoughts, and so uncomfortable
did the whole thing make me
that I determined to pay Dr. Mackenzie a
visit.</p>

<p>Mackenzie was a physician in very large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
practice at Brixton. His name was already
familiar to me&mdash;on one or two occasions I
had met him in consultation. I looked up
his address in the Medical Directory, and that
very evening took a hansom to his house.
He happened to be at home. I sent in my
card and was admitted at once.</p>

<p>Mackenzie received me in his consulting-room,
and I was not long in explaining the
motive of my visit. After a few preliminary
remarks, I said that I would be glad if he
would favour me with full particulars with
regard to Heathcote's death.</p>

<p>"I can easily do so," said Mackenzie.
"The case was a perfectly straightforward
one&mdash;my patient was consumptive, had been
so for years, and died at last of hemoptysis."</p>

<p>"What aged man was he?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Not old&mdash;a little past forty&mdash;a tall, slight,
good-looking man, with a somewhat emaciated
face. In short, his was an ordinary case of
consumption."</p>

<p>I told Mackenzie all about the visit which
I had received from Mrs. Heathcote, and
gave him a faithful version of the strange
story which Miss Gabrielle Heathcote had
told me that day.</p>

<p>"Miss Gabrielle
is an excitable girl,"
replied the doctor.
"I have had a good
deal to do with her
for many years, and
always thought her
nerves highly strung.
She is evidently the
victim of a delusion,
caused by the effect
of grief on a somewhat
delicate organism.
She probably
inherits her father's
disease. Mrs. Heathcote
should take her
from home immediately."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Heathcote
looks as if she
needed change
almost as badly as
her daughter," I
answered; "but now
you will forgive me
if I ask you a few
more questions. Will
you oblige me by
describing Heathcote's
death as faithfully
as you can?"</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 407px;">
<img src="images/i_259.jpg" width="407" height="602" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"I WAS PAYING THE CABMAN HIS FARE."</p></div>
</div>

<p>"Certainly," replied the physician.</p>

<p>He sank down into a chair at the opposite
side of the hearth as he spoke.</p>

<p>"The death, when it came," he continued,
"was, I must confess, unexpected. I had
sounded Heathcote's lungs about three
months previous to the time of his death
seizure. Phthisis was present, but not to an
advanced degree. I recommended his wintering
abroad. He was a solicitor by profession,
and had a good practice. I remember his
asking me, with a comical rise of his brows,
how he was to carry on his profession so
many miles from Chancery Lane. But to
come to his death. It took place six months
ago, in the beginning of September. It had
been a hot season, and I had just returned
from my holiday. My portmanteau and
Gladstone bag had been placed in the hall,
and I was paying the cabman his fare, when
a servant from the Heathcotes arrived, and
begged of me to go immediately to her
master, who was, she said, dying.</p>

<p>"I hurried off to the house without a
moment's delay. It is a stone's throw from here.
In fact, you can see the walls of the garden from
the windows of this
room in the daytime.
I reached the house.
Gabrielle was standing
in the hall. I
am an old friend of
hers. Her face was
quite white and had
a stunned expression.
When she saw me
she rushed to me,
clasped one of my
hands in both of hers,
and burst into tears.</p>

<p>"'Go and save
him!' she gasped,
her voice choking
with sobs, which were
almost hysterical.</p>

<p>"A lady who happened
to be staying
in the house came
and drew the girl
away into one of the
sitting-rooms, and I
went upstairs. I
found Heathcote in
his own room. He
was lying on the bed&mdash;he
was a ghastly
sight. His face wore
the sick hue of death
itself; the sheet, his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
hair, and even his face were all covered with
blood. His wife was standing over him,
wiping away the blood, which oozed from
his lips. I saw, of course, immediately what
was the matter. Hemoptysis had set in,
and I felt that his hours were numbered.</p>

<p>"'He has broken a blood vessel,' exclaimed
Mrs. Heathcote. 'He was standing
here, preparing to go down to dinner, when
he coughed violently&mdash;the blood began to
pour from his mouth: I got him on the bed
and sent for you. The hemorrhage seems
to be a little less violent now.'</p>

<p>"I examined my patient carefully, feeling
his pulse, which was very weak and low; I
cautioned him not to speak a single word,
and asked Mrs. Heathcote to send for some
ice immediately. She did so. I packed him
in ice and gave him a dose of ergotine. He
seemed easier, and I left him, promising to
return again in an hour or two. Miss
Gabrielle met me in the hall as I went out.</p>

<p>"'Is he any better? Is there any hope at
all?' she asked, as I left the house.</p>

<p>"'Your father is easier now,' I replied;
'the hemorrhage has been arrested. I am
coming back soon. You must be a good
girl and try to comfort your mother in
every way in your power.'</p>

<p>"'Then there is no hope?' she answered,
looking me full in the face.</p>

<p>"I could not truthfully say that there was.
I knew poor Heathcote's days were numbered,
although I scarcely thought the end would
come so quickly."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" I inquired.</p>

<p>"Why this," he replied. "Less than an
hour after I got home, I received a brief note
from Mrs. Heathcote. In it she stated that
fresh and very violent hemorrhage had set
in almost immediately after I left, and that
her husband was dead."</p>

<p>"And&mdash;" I continued.</p>

<p>"Well, that is the story. Poor Heathcote
had died of hemoptysis."</p>

<p>"Did you see the body after death?"
I inquired, after a pause.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;it was absolutely unnecessary&mdash;the
cause of death was so evident. I attended
the funeral, though. Heathcote was buried
at Kensal Green."</p>

<p>I made no comment for a moment or two.</p>

<p>"I am sorry you did not see the body
after death," I said, after a pause.</p>

<p>My remark seemed to irritate Mackenzie.
He looked at me with raised brows.</p>

<p>"Would you have thought it necessary to
do so?" he asked. "A man known to be
consumptive dies of violent hemorrhage of
the lungs. The family are in great trouble&mdash;there
is much besides to think of. Would
you under the circumstances have considered
it necessary to refuse to give a certificate
without seeing the body?"</p>

<p>I thought for a moment.</p>

<p>"I make a rule of always seeing the body,"
I replied; "but, of course, you were justified,
as the law stands. Well, then, there is no
doubt Heathcote is really dead?"</p>

<p>"Really dead?" retorted Mackenzie.
"Don't you understand that he has been in his
grave for six months?&mdash;That I practically saw
him die?&mdash;That I attended his funeral? By
what possible chance can the man be alive?"</p>

<p>"None," I replied. "He is dead, of
course. I am sorry for the poor girl. She
ought to leave home immediately."</p>

<p>"Girls of her age often have delusions,"
said Mackenzie. "I doubt not this will
pass in time. I am surprised, however, that
the Heathcotes allowed the thing to go on
so long. I remember now that I have never
been near the house since the funeral. I
cannot understand their not calling me in."</p>

<p>"That fact puzzles me also," I said.
"They came to me, a total stranger, instead
of consulting their family physician, and
Mrs. Heathcote carefully concealed the most
important part of her daughter's malady. It
is strange altogether; and, although I can
give no explanation whatever, I am convinced
there is one if we could only get at
it. One more question before I go, Mackenzie.
You spoke of Heathcote as a
solicitor: has he left his family well off?"</p>

<p>"They are not rich," replied Mackenzie;
"but as far as I can tell, they don't seem to
want for money. I believe their house,
Ivy Hall is its name, belongs to them. They
live there very quietly, with a couple of maid-servants.
I should say they belonged to the
well-to-do middle classes."</p>

<p>"Then money troubles cannot explain the
mystery?" I replied.</p>

<p>"Believe me, there is no mystery," answered
Mackenzie, in an annoyed voice.</p>

<p>I held out my hand to wish him good-bye,
when a loud peal at the front door startled
us both. If ever there was frantic haste in
anything, there was in that ringing peal.</p>

<p>"Someone wants you in a hurry," I said
to the doctor.</p>

<p>He was about to reply, when the door of
the consulting-room was flung wide open, and
Gabrielle Heathcote rushed into the room.</p>

<p>"Mother is very ill," she exclaimed. "I
think she is out of her mind. Come to her
at once."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span></p>

<div class="caption"><p>"GABRIELLE HEATHCOTE RUSHED INTO THE ROOM."</p></div>
</div>

<p>She took Mackenzie's hand in hers.</p>

<p>"There isn't a minute to lose," she said,
"she may kill herself. She came to me with
a carving-knife in her hand; I rushed away at
once for you. The two servants are with her
now, and they are doing all they can; but, oh!
pray, do be quick."</p>

<p>At this moment Gabrielle's eyes rested on
me. A look of relief and almost ecstasy
passed over her poor, thin little face.</p>

<p>"You are here!" she exclaimed. "You
will come, too? Oh, how glad I am."</p>

<p>"If Dr. Mackenzie will permit me," I
replied, "I shall be only too pleased to
accompany him."</p>

<p>"By all means come, you may be of the
greatest use," he answered.</p>

<p>We started at once. As soon as we left
the house Gabrielle rushed from us.</p>

<p>"I am going to have the front door open
for you both when you arrive," she exclaimed.
She disappeared as if on the wings of the
wind.</p>

<p>"That is a good girl," I said, turning to
the other doctor.</p>

<p>"She has always been deeply attached to
both her parents," he answered.</p>

<p>We did not either of us say another word
until we got to Ivy Hall. It was a rambling
old house, with numerous low rooms and a
big entrance-hall. I could fancy that in the
summer it was cheerful enough, with its large,
walled-in garden. The night was a dark one,
but there would be a moon presently.</p>

<p>Gabrielle was waiting in the hall to receive
us.</p>

<p>"I will take you to the door of mother's
room," she exclaimed.</p>

<p>Her words came out tremblingly, her face
was like death. She was shaking all over.
She ran up the stairs before us, and then
down a long passage which led to a room a
little apart from the rest of the house.</p>

<p>"I told you mother wished to sleep in a
room as far away from me as possible," she
said, flashing a glance into my face as she
spoke.</p>

<p>I nodded in reply. We opened the door
and went in. The sight which met our eyes
was one with which most medical men are
familiar.</p>

<p>The patient was lying on the bed in a state
of violent delirium. Two maid-servants were
bending over her, and evidently much exciting
her feelings in their efforts to hold her down.
I spoke at once with authority.</p>

<p>"You can leave the room now," I said&mdash;"only
remain within call in case you are
wanted."</p>

<p>They obeyed instantly, looking at me with
surprised glances, and at Mackenzie with
manifest relief.</p>

<p>I shut the door after them and approached
the bed. One glance showed that Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
Heathcote was not mad in the ordinary
sense, but that she was suffering at the
moment from acute delirium. I put my
hand on her forehead: it burned with fever.
Her pulse was rapid and uneven. Mackenzie
took her temperature, which was very nearly
a hundred and four degrees. While we were
examining her she remained quiet, but presently,
as we stood together and watched her,
she began to rave again.</p>

<p>"What is it, Gabrielle? No, no, he is
quite dead, child. I tell you I saw the men
screw his coffin down. He's dead&mdash;quite
dead. Oh, God! oh, God! yes, dead, dead!"</p>

<p>She sat up in bed and stared straight
before her.</p>

<p>"You mustn't come here so often," she
said, looking past us into the centre of the
room, and addressing someone whom she
seemed to see with distinctness, "I tell you it
isn't safe. Gabrielle suspects. Don't come
so often&mdash;I'll manage some other way.
Trust me. Do trust me. You know I won't
let you starve. Oh, go away, go away."</p>

<p>She flung herself back on the bed and
pressed her hands frantically to her burning
eyes.</p>

<p>"Your father has been dead six months
now, Gabrielle," she said, presently, in a
changed voice.</p>

<p>"No one was ever more dead. I tell you
I saw him die;
he was buried,
and you went to
his funeral."
Here again her
voice altered. She
sat upright and
motioned with
her hand. "Will
you bring the
coffin in here,
please, into this
room? Yes; it
seems a nice
coffin&mdash;well
finished. The
coffin is made of
oak. That is
right. Oak lasts.
I can't bear
coffins that
crumble away
very quickly. This
is a good one&mdash;you
have taken
pains with it&mdash;I
am pleased. Lay
him in gently.
"He is not very heavy, is he? You see
how worn he is. Consumption!&mdash;yes,
consumption. He had been a long time
dying, but at the end it was sudden.
Hemorrhage of the lungs. We did it to save
Gabrielle, and to keep away&mdash;what, what,
<i>what</i> did we want to keep away?&mdash;Oh, yes,
dishonour! The&mdash;the&mdash;" Here she burst
into a loud laugh.</p>

<p>"You don't suppose, you undertaker's men,
that I'm going to tell you what we did it for?
Dr. Mackenzie was there&mdash;he saw him just at
the end. Now you have placed him nicely in
his coffin, and you can go. Thank you, you
can go now. I don't want you to see his
face. A dead face is too sacred. You must
not look on it. He is peaceful, only pale,
very pale. All dead people look pale. Is
he as pale as most dead people? Oh, I
forgot&mdash;you can't see him. And as cold?
Oh, yes, I think so, quite. You want to
screw the coffin down, of course, of course&mdash;I
was forgetting. Now, be quick about it.
Why, do you know, I was very nearly having
him buried with the coffin open! Screw away
now, screw away. Ah, how that noise grates
on my nerves. I shall go mad if you are not
quick. Do be quick&mdash;be <i>quick</i>, and leave me
alone with my dead. Oh, God, with my
dead, my dead!"</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 588px;">
<img src="images/i_262.jpg" width="588" height="513" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"HAVE MERCY UPON ME AND UPON MY DEAD."</p></div>
</div>

<p>The wretched woman's voice sank to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
hoarse whisper. She struggled on to her
knees, and folding her hands, began to pray.</p>

<p>"God in Heaven have mercy upon me and
upon my dead," she moaned. "Now, now,
now! where's the screwdriver? Oh, <i>heavens</i>,
it's lost, it's lost! We are undone! My God,
what is the matter with me? My brain reels.
Oh, my God, my God!"</p>

<p>She moaned tearfully. We laid her back
on the bed. Her mutterings became more
rapid and indistinct. Presently she slept.</p>

<p>"She must not be left in this condition,"
said Mackenzie to me. "It would be very
bad for Gabrielle to be with her mother now.
And those young servants are not to be
trusted. I will go and send in a nurse as
soon as possible. Can you do me the inestimable
favour of remaining here until a
nurse arrives?"</p>

<p>"I was going to propose that I should, in
any case, spend the night here," I replied.</p>

<p>"That is more than good of you," said
the doctor.</p>

<p>"Not at all," I answered; "the case
interests me extremely."</p>

<p>A moment or two later Mackenzie left the
house. During his absence Mrs. Heathcote
slept, and I sat and watched her. The fever
raged very high&mdash;she muttered constantly in
her terrible dreams, but said nothing coherent.
I felt very anxious about her. She had
evidently been subjected to a most frightful
strain, and now all her nature was giving
way. I dared not think what her words
implied. My mission was at present to do
what I could for her relief.</p>

<p>The nurse arrived about midnight. She
was a sensible, middle-aged woman, very
strong too, and evidently accustomed to
fever patients. I gave her some directions,
desired her to ring a certain bell if she
required my assistance, and left the room.
As I went slowly downstairs I noticed the
moon had risen. The house was perfectly still&mdash;the
sick woman's moans could not be heard
beyond the distant wing of the house where
she slept. As I went downstairs I remembered
Gabrielle's story about the moonlit
garden and her father's figure standing there.
I felt a momentary curiosity to see what the
garden was like, and, moving aside a blind,
which concealed one of the lobby windows,
looked out. I gave one hurried glance and
started back. Was I, too, the victim of
illusion? Standing in the garden was the
tall figure of a man with folded arms. He
was looking away from me, but the light fell
on his face: it was cadaverous and ghastly
white; his hat was off; he moved into a deep
shadow. It was all done in an instant&mdash;he
came and went like a flash.</p>

<p>I pursued my way softly downstairs. This
man's appearance seemed exactly to coincide
with Mackenzie's description of Heathcote:
but was it possible, in any of the wonderful
possibilities of this earth, that a man could
rise from his coffin and walk the earth again?</p>

<p>Gabrielle was waiting for me in the cheerful
drawing-room. A bright fire burned in
the grate, there were candles on brackets,
and one or two shaded lamps placed on
small tables. On one table, a little larger
than the rest, a white cloth was spread. It
also contained a tray with glasses, some
claret and sherry in decanters, and a plate of
sandwiches.</p>

<p>"You must be tired," said Gabrielle.
"Please have a glass of wine, and please eat
something. I know those sandwiches are
good&mdash;I made them myself."</p>

<p>She pressed me to eat and drink. In
truth, I needed refreshment. The scene in
the sick room had told even on my iron
nerves, and the sight from the lobby window
had almost taken my breath away.</p>

<p>Gabrielle attended on me as if she were
my daughter. I was touched by her solicitude,
and by the really noble way in which
she tried to put self out of sight. At last she
said, in a voice which shook with emotion:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I know, Dr. Halifax, that you think
badly of mother."</p>

<p>"Your mother is very ill indeed," I
answered.</p>

<p>"It is good of you to come and help her.
You are a great doctor, are you not?"</p>

<p>I smiled at the child's question.</p>

<p>"I want you to tell me something about
the beginning of your mother's illness," I
said, after a pause. "When I saw her two days
ago, she scarcely considered herself ill at all&mdash;in
fact, you were supposed to be the patient."</p>

<p>Gabrielle dropped into the nearest chair.</p>

<p>"There is a mystery somewhere," she said,
"but I cannot make it out. When I came
back, after seeing you to-day, mother seemed
very restless and troubled. I thought she
would have questioned me about being so
long away, and ask me at least what I had
done with myself. Instead of that, she asked
me to tread softly. She said she had such
an intolerable headache that she could
not endure the least sound. I saw she had
been out, for she had her walking boots on,
and they were covered with mud. I tried to
coax her to eat something, but she would not,
and as I saw she really wished to be alone,
I left her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span></p>

<p>"At tea time, our parlour-maid, Peters,
told me that mother had gone to bed and
had given directions that she was on no
account to be disturbed. I had tea alone,
and then came in here and made the place
as bright and comfortable as I could. Once
or twice before, since my father's death,
mother has suffered from acute headaches,
and has gone to bed; but when they got
better, she has dressed and come downstairs
again. I thought she might like to do so
to-night, and that she would be pleased to
see a bright room and everything cheerful
about her.</p>

<p>"I got a story-book and tried to read, but
my thoughts were with mother, and I felt
dreadfully puzzled and anxious. The time
seemed very long too, and I heartily wished
that the night were over. I went upstairs
about eight o'clock, and listened outside
mother's door. She was moaning and talking
to herself. It seemed to me that she was
saying dreadful things. I quite shuddered as
I listened. I knocked at the door, but there
was no answer. Then I turned the handle
and tried to enter, but the door was locked.
I went downstairs
again, and Peters
came to ask me if I
would like supper.
She was still in the
room, and I had not
made up my mind
whether I could eat
anything or not,
when I heard her
give a short scream,
and turning round,
I saw mother standing
in the room in
her nightdress. She
had the carving-knife
in her hand.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 383px;">
<img src="images/i_264.jpg" width="383" height="594" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"IS THERE ANY BLOOD ON MY HANDS?"</p></div>
</div>

<p>"'Gabrielle,' she
said, in a quiet
voice, but with an
awful look in her
eyes, 'I want you
to tell me the truth.
Is there any blood
on my hands?'</p>

<p>"'No, no, mother,'
I answered.</p>

<p>"She gave a deep
sigh, and looked at
them as if she were
Lady Macbeth.</p>

<p>"'Gabrielle,' she
said again, 'I can't
live any longer without your father. I have
made this knife sharp, and it won't take long.'</p>

<p>"Then she turned and left the room.
Peters ran for cook, and they went upstairs
after her, and I rushed for Dr. Mackenzie."</p>

<p>"It was a fearful ordeal for you," I said,
"and you behaved very bravely; but you
must not think too much about your
mother's condition, nor about any words
which she happened to say. She is highly
feverish at present, and is not accountable
for her actions. Sit down now, please, and
take a glass of wine yourself."</p>

<p>"No, thank you&mdash;I never take wine."</p>

<p>"I'm glad to hear you say so, for in that
case a glass of this good claret will do
wonders for you. Here, I'm going to pour
one out&mdash;now drink it off at once."</p>

<p>She obeyed me with a patient sort of
smile. She was very pale, but the wine
brought some colour into her cheeks.</p>

<p>"I am interested in your story," I said,
after a pause. "Particularly in what you
told me about your poor father. He must
have been an interesting man, for you to
treasure his memory so deeply. Do you
mind describing
him to me?"</p>

<p>She flushed up
when I spoke. I
saw that tears were
very near her eyes,
and she bit her
lips to keep back
emotion.</p>

<p>"My father was
like no one else,"
she said. "It is
impossible for me
to make a picture
of him for one who
has not seen him."</p>

<p>"But you can at
least tell me if he
were tall or short,
dark or fair, old or
young?"</p>

<p>"No, I can't,"
she said, after
another pause.
"He was just
father. When you
love your father, he
has a kind of
eternal youth to
you, and you don't
discriminate his
features. If you
are his only child,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
his is just the one face in all the world to you.
I find it impossible to describe the face,
although it fills my mind's eye, waking and
sleeping. But, stay, I have a picture of him.
I don't show it to many, but you shall see it."</p>

<p>She rushed out of the room, returning in
a moment with a morocco case. She opened
it, and brought over a candle at the same
time so that the light should fall on the
picture within. It represented a tall, slight
man, with deep-set eyes and a very thin face.
The eyes were somewhat piercing in their
glance; the lips were closely set and firm;
the chin was cleft. The face showed determination.
I gave it a quick glance, and,
closing the case, returned it to Gabrielle.</p>

<p>The face was the face of the man I had
seen in the garden.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>My patient passed a dreadful night. She
was no better the next morning. Her temperature
was rather higher, her pulse quicker,
her respiration more hurried. Her ravings
had now become almost incoherent.
Mackenzie and I had an anxious consultation
over her. When he left the house I
accompanied him.</p>

<p>"I am going to make a strange request of
you," I said. "I wish for your assistance,
and am sure you will not refuse to give it
to me. In short, I want to take immediate
steps to have Heathcote's coffin opened."</p>

<p>I am quite sure Mackenzie thought that I
was mad. He looked at me, opened his lips
as if to speak, but then waited to hear my
next words.</p>

<p>"I want to have Heathcote's body exhumed,"
I said. "If you will listen to me, I
will tell you why."</p>

<p>I then gave him a graphic account of the
man I had seen in the garden.</p>

<p>"There is foul play somewhere," I said, in
conclusion. "I have been dragged into this
thing almost against my will, and now I am
determined to see it through."</p>

<p>Mackenzie flung up his hands.</p>

<p>"I don't pretend to doubt your wisdom,"
he said; "but to ask me gravely to assist you
to exhume the body of a man who died of consumption
six months ago, is enough to take my
breath away. What reason can you possibly
give to the authorities for such an action?"</p>

<p>"That I have strong grounds for believing
that the death never took place at all," I
replied. "Now, will you co-operate with me
in this matter, or not?"</p>

<p>"Oh, of course, I'll co-operate with you,"
he answered. "But I don't pretend to say
that I like the business."</p>

<p>We walked together to his house, talking
over the necessary steps which must be taken
to get an order for exhumation. Mackenzie
promised to telegraph to me as soon as ever
this was obtained, and I was obliged to hurry
off to attend to my own duties. As I was
stepping into my hansom I turned to ask the
doctor one more question.</p>

<p>"Have you any reason to suppose that
Heathcote was heavily insured?" I asked.</p>

<p>"No, I don't know anything about it,"
he answered.</p>

<p>"You are quite sure there were no money
troubles anywhere?"</p>

<p>"I do not know of any; but that fact
amounts to nothing, for I was not really
intimate with the family, and, as I said
yesterday evening, never entered the house
until last night from the day of the funeral.
I have never <i>heard</i> of money troubles; but, of
course, they might have existed."</p>

<p>"As soon as ever I hear from you, I will
make an arrangement to meet you at Kensal
Green," I replied, and then I jumped into
the hansom and drove away.</p>

<p>In the course of the day I got a telegram
acquainting me with Mrs. Heathcote's
condition. It still remained absolutely
unchanged, and there was, in Mackenzie's
opinion, no necessity for me to pay her
another visit. Early the next morning, the
required order came from the coroner.
Mackenzie wired to apprise me of the fact,
and I telegraphed back, making an appointment
to meet him at Kensal Green on the
following morning.</p>

<p>I shall not soon forget that day. It was
one of those blustering and intensely cold
days which come oftener in March than any
other time of the year. The cemetery looked
as dismal as such a place would on the
occasion. The few wreaths of flowers which
were scattered here and there on newly-made
graves were sodden and deprived of all their
frail beauty. The wind blew in great gusts,
which were about every ten minutes accompanied
by showers of sleet. There was a
hollow moaning noise distinctly audible in
the intervals of the storm.</p>

<p>I found, on my arrival, that Mackenzie was
there before me. He was accompanied by one
of the coroner's men and a police-constable.
Two men who worked in the cemetery also
came forward to assist. No one expressed
the least surprise at our strange errand.
Around Mackenzie's lips, alone, I read an
expression of disapproval.</p>

<p>Kensal Green is one of the oldest cemeteries
which surround our vast Metropolis,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
and the Heathcotes' burying-place was quite
in the oldest portion of this God's acre. It
was one of the hideous, ancient, rapidly-going-out-of-date
vaults. A huge brick
erection was placed over it, at one side of
which was the door of entrance.</p>

<p>The earth was removed, the door of the
vault opened, and some of the men went
down the steps, one of them holding a torch,
in order to identify the coffin. In a couple
of minutes' time it was borne into the light of
day. When I saw it I remembered poor
Mrs. Heathcote's wild ravings.</p>

<p>"A good, strong oak coffin, which wears
well," she had exclaimed.</p>

<p>Mackenzie and I, accompanied by the
police-constable and the coroner's man,
followed the bearers of the coffin to the
mortuary.</p>

<p>As we were going there, I turned to ask
Mackenzie how his patient was.</p>

<p>He shook his head as he answered me.</p>

<p>"I fear the worst," he replied. "Mrs.
Heathcote is very ill indeed. The fever rages
high and is like a consuming fire. Her
temperature was a hundred and five this
morning."</p>

<p>"I should recommend packing her in
sheets wrung out of cold water," I answered.
"Poor woman!&mdash;how do you account for
this sudden illness, Mackenzie?"</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"Shock of some sort," he answered. Then
he continued: "If she really knew of this
day's work, it would kill her off pretty
quickly. Poor soul," he added, "I hope
it may never reach her ears."</p>

<div class="caption"><p>"THEY UNSCREWED THE LID."</p></div>
</div>

<p>We had now
reached the mortuary.
The men
who had borne
the coffin on their
shoulders lowered
it on to a pair of
trestles. They
then took turn-screws
out of their
pockets, and in a
business-like and
callous manner
unscrewed the lid.
After doing this
they left the mortuary,
closing the
door behind
them.</p>

<p>The moment
we found ourselves
alone, I
said a word to the police-constable, and then
going quickly up to the coffin, lifted the lid.
Under ordinary circumstances, such a proceeding
would be followed by appalling
results, which need not here be described.
Mackenzie, whose face was very white, stood
near me. I looked at him for a moment,
and then flung aside the pall which was
meant to conceal the face of the dead.</p>

<p>The dead truly! Here was death, which
had never, in any sense, known life like ours.
Mackenzie uttered a loud exclamation. The
constable and the coroner's man came close.
I lifted a bag of flour out of the coffin!</p>

<p>There were many similar bags there. It
had been closely packed, and evidently with
a view to counterfeit the exact weight of the
dead man.</p>

<p>Poor Mackenzie was absolutely speechless.
The coroner's man began to take copious
notes; the police-constable gravely did the
same.</p>

<p>Mackenzie at last found his tongue.</p>

<p>"I never felt more stunned in my life," he
said. "In very truth, I all but saw the man
die. Where is he? In the name of Heaven,
what has become of him? This is the most
monstrous thing I have ever heard of in the
whole course of my life, and&mdash;and I attended
the funeral of those <i>bags of flour</i>! No
wonder that woman never cared to see me
inside the house again. But what puzzles
me," he continued, "is the motive&mdash;what <i>can</i>
the motive be?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps one of the insurance companies
can tell us that," said the police-officer. "It
is my duty to report this thing, sir," he con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>tinued,
turning to me. "I have not the
least doubt that the Crown will prosecute."</p>

<p>"I cannot at all prevent your taking what
steps you think proper," I replied, "only
pray understand that the poor lady who is
the principal perpetrator in this fraud lies at
the present moment at death's door."</p>

<p>"We must get the man himself," murmured
the police-officer. "If he is alive we shall
soon find him."</p>

<p>Half an hour later, Mackenzie and I had
left the dismal cemetery.</p>

<p>I had to hurry back to Harley Street to
attend to some important duties, but I
arranged to meet Mackenzie that evening at
the Heathcotes' house. I need not say that
my thoughts were much occupied with Mrs.
Heathcote and her miserable story. What a
life that wretched Heathcote must have led
during the last six months. No wonder he
looked cadaverous as the moonlight fell over
his gaunt figure. No ghost truly was he, but
a man of like flesh and blood to ourselves&mdash;a
man who was supposed to be buried in
Kensal Green, but who yet walked the earth.</p>

<p>It was about eight o'clock when I reached
the Heathcotes' house. Mackenzie had
already arrived&mdash;he came into the hall to
meet me.</p>

<p>"Where is Miss Gabrielle?" I asked at once.</p>

<p>"Poor child," he replied; "I have begged
of her to stay in her room. She knows
nothing of what took place this morning, but
is in a terrible state of grief about her
mother. That unfortunate woman's hours
are numbered. She is sinking fast. Will
you come to her at once, Halifax&mdash;she has
asked for you several times."</p>

<p>Accompanied by Mackenzie, I mounted
the stairs and entered the sick room. One
glance at the patient's face showed me all too
plainly that I was in the chamber of death.
Mrs. Heathcote lay perfectly motionless.
Her bright hair, still the hair of quite a young
woman, was flung back over the pillow.
Her pale face was wet with perspiration. Her
eyes, solemn, dark, and awful in expression,
turned and fixed themselves on me as I
approached the bedside. Something like the
ghost of a smile quivered round her lips.
She made an effort to stretch out a shadowy
hand to grasp mine.</p>

<p>"Don't stir," I said to her. "Perhaps
you want to say something? I will stoop
down to listen to you. I have very good
hearing, so you can speak as low as you
please."</p>

<p>She smiled again with a sort of pleasure at
my understanding her.</p>

<p>"I have something to confess," she said, in
a hollow whisper. "Send the nurse and&mdash;and
Dr. Mackenzie out of the room."</p>

<p>I was obliged to explain the dying woman's
wishes to my brother physician. He called
to the nurse to follow him, and they immediately
left the room.</p>

<p>As soon as they had done so, I bent my
head and took one of Mrs. Heathcote's hands
in mine.</p>

<p>"Now," I said, "take comfort&mdash;God can
forgive sin. You have sinned?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, yes; but how can you possibly
know?"</p>

<p>"Never mind. I am a good judge of
character. If telling me will relieve your
conscience, speak."</p>

<p>"My husband is alive," she murmured.</p>

<p>"Yes," I said, "I guessed as much."</p>

<p>"He had insured his life," she continued,
"for&mdash;for about fifteen thousand pounds.
The money was wanted to&mdash;to save us from
dishonour. We managed to counterfeit&mdash;death."</p>

<p>She stopped, as if unable to proceed any
further. "A week ago," she continued, "I&mdash;I
saw the man who is supposed to be dead.
He is really dying now. The strain of knowing
that I could do nothing for him&mdash;nothing
to comfort his last moments&mdash;was too horrible.
I felt that I could not live without him. On
the day of my illness I took&mdash;poison, a preparation
of Indian hemp. I meant to kill
myself. I did not know that my object
would be effected in so terrible a manner."</p>

<p>Here she looked towards the door. A
great change came over her face. Her eyes
shone with sudden brightness. A look of
awful joy filled them. She made a frantic
effort to raise herself in bed.</p>

<p>I followed the direction of her eyes, and
then, indeed, a startled exclamation passed
my lips.</p>

<p>Gabrielle, with her cheeks crimson, her lips
tremulous, her hair tossed wildly about her
head and shoulders, was advancing into the
room, leading a cadaverous, ghastly-looking
man by the hand. In other words, Heathcote
himself in the flesh had come into his
wife's dying chamber.</p>

<p>"Oh, Horace!" she exclaimed; "Horace&mdash;to
die in your arms&mdash;to know that you will
soon join me. This is too much bliss&mdash;this
is too great joy!"</p>

<p>The man knelt by her, put his dying arms
round her, and she laid her head on his worn
breast.</p>

<p>"We will leave them together," I said to
Gabrielle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span></p>

<div class="caption"><p>"LEADING A CADAVEROUS, GHASTLY-LOOKING
MAN BY THE HAND."</p></div>
</div>

<p>I took the poor little girl's hand and led
her from the room.</p>

<p>She was in a frantic state of excitement.</p>

<p>"I said he was not dead," she repeated&mdash;"I
always said it. I was sitting by my window
a few minutes ago, and I saw him in the
garden. This time I was determined that he
should not escape me. I rushed downstairs.
He knew nothing until he saw me at his side.
I caught his hand in mine. It was hot and
thin. It was like a skeleton's hand&mdash;only it
burned with living fire. 'Mother is dying&mdash;come
to her at once,' I said to him, and then
I brought him into the house."</p>

<p>"You did well&mdash;you acted very bravely,"
I replied to her.</p>

<p>I took her away to a distant part of the
house.</p>

<p>An hour later, Mrs. Heathcote died. I
was not with her when she breathed her last.
My one object now was to do what I could
for poor little Gabrielle. In consequence,
therefore, I made arrangements to have an
interview with Heathcote. It was no longer
possible for the wretched man to remain
in hiding. His own hours were plainly
numbered, and it was more than evident that
he had only anticipated his real death by
some months.</p>

<p>I saw him the next day, and he told me
in a few brief words the story of his supposed
death and burial.</p>

<p>"I am being severely punished now," he
said, "for the one great sin of my life. I am
a solicitor by profession, and when a young
man was tempted to appropriate some trust
funds&mdash;hoping, like many another has done
before me, to replace the money before the
loss was discovered. I married, and had a
happy home. My wife and I were devotedly
attached to each other. I was not strong,
and more than one physician told me that
I was threatened with a serious pulmonary
affection. About eight months ago, the blow
which I never looked for fell. I need not
enter into particulars. Suffice it to say
that I was expected to deliver over
twelve thousand pounds, the amount of
certain trusts committed to me, to their
rightful owners within three months' time.
If I failed to realize this money, imprisonment,
dishonour, ruin, would be mine.
My wife and child would also be reduced
to beggary. I had effected an insurance
on my life for fifteen thousand pounds.
If this sum could be realized, it would
cover the deficit in the trust, and also
leave a small overplus for the use of my
wife and daughter. I knew that my days
were practically numbered, and it did not
strike me as a particularly heinous crime to
forestall my death by a few months. I talked
the matter over with my wife, and at last got
her to consent to help me. We managed
everything cleverly, and not a soul suspected
the fraud which was practised on the world.
Our old servants, who had lived with us for
years, were sent away on a holiday. We had no
servant in the house except a charwoman, who
came in for a certain number of hours daily."</p>

<p>"You managed your supposed dying
condition with great skill," I answered.
"That hemorrhage, the ghastly expression
of your face, were sufficiently real to deceive
even a keen and clever man like Mackenzie."</p>

<p>Heathcote smiled grimly.</p>

<p>"After all," he said, "the fraud was simple
enough. I took an emetic, which I knew
would produce the cadaverous hue of
approaching death, and the supposed
hemorrhage was managed with some
bullock's blood. I got it from a distant
butcher, telling him that I wanted it to mix
with meal to feed my dogs with."</p>

<p>"And how did you deceive the undertaker's
men?" I asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span></p>

<p>"My wife insisted on keeping my face
covered, and I managed to simulate rigidity.
As to the necessary coldness, I was cold
enough lying with only a sheet over me.
After I was placed in the coffin my wife
would not allow anyone to enter the room
but herself: she brought me food, of course.
We bored holes, too, in the coffin lid. Still,
I shall never forget the awful five minutes
during which I was screwed down.</p>

<p>"It was all managed with great expedition.
As soon as ever the undertaker's men could
be got out of the way, my wife unscrewed
the coffin and released me. We then filled
it with bags of flour, which we had already
secured and hidden for the purpose. My
supposed funeral took place with due honours.
I left the house that night, intending to ship
to America. Had I done this, the appalling
consequences which have now ended in the
death of my wife might never have taken
place, but, at the eleventh hour, my courage
failed me. I could do much to shield my
wife and child, but I could not endure
the thought of
never seeing them
again. Contrary
to all my wife's
entreaties, I insisted
on coming
into the garden,
for the selfish
pleasure of catching
even a glimpse
of Gabrielle's
little figure, as she
moved about her
bedroom. She
saw me once, but
I escaped through
the shrubbery and
by a door which
we kept on purpose
unlocked,
before she
reached me. I
thought I would
never again transgress,
but once
more the temptation assailed me, and I was
not proof against it. My health failed rapidly.
I was really dying, and on the morning when
my wife's illness began, had suffered from a
genuine and very sharp attack of hemorrhage.
She found me in the wretched lodging where
I was hiding in a state of complete misery,
and almost destitution. Something in my
appearance seemed suddenly to make her
lose all self-control.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 454px;">
<img src="images/i_269.jpg" width="454" height="609" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"WHEN YOU DIE, I WILL DIE."</p></div>
</div>

<p>"'Horace,' she exclaimed, 'I cannot stand
this. When you die, I will die. We will
carry our shame and our sorrow and our
unhappy love into the grave, where no man
can follow us. When you die, I will die.
Oh, to see you like this drives me mad!'</p>

<p>"She left me. She told me when I saw
her during those last few moments yesterday,
that she had hastened her end by a powerful
dose of Indian hemp. That is the story.
I know that I have laid myself open to
criminal prosecution of the gravest character,
but I do not think I shall live to go through
it."</p>

<p>Heathcote was
right. He passed
away that evening
quite quietly
in his sleep.</p>

<p>Poor little
Gabrielle! I
saw her once
since her parents'
death, but it is
now a couple of
years since I have
heard anything
about her. Will
she ever get over
the severe shock
to which she
was subjected?
What does the
future hold in
store for her?
I cannot answer
these questions.
Time alone can
do that.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">No. II. Burglars and Burgling.</span></h3>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_273.png" width="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Of</span> all the more hazardous&mdash;though
thoroughly romantic&mdash;professions,
none is more interesting
than that of burgling.
The art of burgling
and housebreaking has positively
developed into a fine art, and,
although we do not admire the members of
the craft, yet every individual representative of
it is undeniably interesting. There is something
irresistibly tantalizing, yet at the same
time fascinating, about your average burglar.
Those of nervous temperament may look
under their beds for a whole twelvemonth&mdash;from
the 1st of January to the 31st of
December. But he is never there. He is a
playful fellow&mdash;a merry man; he likes his
joke, for on the very night you forget to peep
under the couch where Morpheus receives
you for a few hours, he is bound to be there,
and the next morning you find all your
drawers ransacked. At first you put it down
to the dog, but when you discover that
something like a cart-load of valuables has
disappeared, you
come to the conclusion
that no representative
of the
canine world who
ever barked or
picked an honest
bone could possibly
help himself
so freely and with
so liberal a hand.</p>

<p>The New Scotland
Yard Museum
will provide much
practical information
on the ways
and means which
our friend the
enemy utilizes for
the purpose of
thus annoying you.
Your enterprising
burglar shall have
what he thoroughly
deserves&mdash;a complete
chapter to
himself, and illustrated
with his
own weapons of
warfare into the
bargain. Not that
we expect that he will be much gratified at
the publicity here given to his methods&mdash;a
publicity which is all to the advantage of
his enemy, the householder, for whom to be
forewarned is to be forearmed.</p>

<p>Our burglar friends may find a grain of comfort
in this fact&mdash;that we frankly acknowledge
that it is impossible for us to give them as
much space in these pages as their unquestionable
genius deserves. They are really
too inventive&mdash;too enterprising. Still, the
exhibits in the museum will be of considerable
help. The exhibits here comprise samples of
probably every tool used in the pursuit of
this profession. It has always been an open
question as to where burglars and housebreakers
obtain their tools. Some three or
four years ago it was stated at the Dalston
Police Court that one man makes all the
burglars' "jemmies" in London, and further
that the police knew the man well, were on
familiar terms with his own particular trade,
but there was positively no law by which he
could be arrested or stopped.</p>

<img src="images/i_274a.jpg" width="643" height="255" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>BURGLARS' LANTERNS.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Again, a burglar&mdash;who was the terror of
Birmingham for many years, and who had
done fourteen years' penal servitude for
burglary and attempted murder&mdash;was of the
decided opinion that more tools were
manufactured in Birmingham than in any
town in the country, while the greatest
"authority" on burglars' tools in general,
and "jemmies" in particular, was the
famous American bank burglar, Adams,
whose instruments were treasured and
preserved at the New York police headquarters.
It is probable, however, that most
instruments are home-made, or manufactured
by an honest&mdash;in a strictly burglarian sense&mdash;blacksmith.</p>

<p>The first object of housebreaking curiosity
you meet with at the New Scotland Yard
Black Museum is a complete safe-breaker's
outfit, collected at different times by Superintendent
Shore, and most artistically set out
on a board covered with red baize. The
dark lantern is in
the centre, the
steel jemmy surmounts
the
whole, running
in a symmetrically
decorative
line along the
top, and amongst
the various items
one notices the
prising instrument,
steel
wedges, wood
used for obtaining
leverage,
delicately constructed
saws,
files, and a box
of Graduated
Schultz powder, the latter explosive being used
for blowing in a lock when the place where the
safe is situated is left totally unattended, and
there is no fear of the explosion acting as an
alarum.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 627px;">
<img src="images/i_274b.jpg" width="627" height="363" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>KEY-HOLE LANTERNS.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Burglars' lanterns vary in size&mdash;they are
known as "darkeys" in the profession&mdash;the
better class of lantern now in use being of
the police pattern; a trifle bulky, perhaps,
but nevertheless being very reliable,
seeing that they are similar to those of
Government make. The group of lanterns
at the museum may have cost anything
between fourpence and a shilling each,
certainly no more. Their owners invariably
carry them away, unless disturbed, when
they are left behind as a legacy. The
police seldom attach any importance to the
finding of a lantern. Yet one or two of them
are ingeniously made. Here is one made
out of a Bryant and May's match-box. A
handle has been put on to the box proper and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
a space made for the light to come through,
so as to be easily covered with the thumb.
Such a lantern as this would be used when
using a small jemmy. Its companions have a
light-hole even smaller still. They are ordinary
lanterns with the glass taken out, a piece
of tin inserted, and a hole made only just of
sufficient size to allow enough light to pick
a key-hole. Perhaps, however, the most
ingenious of them all is a small bottle
containing a tiny piece of phosphorus.
Our friend&mdash;once the owner of this highly
interesting relic&mdash;merely had to "shake
the bottle," when, lo and behold! he
had all the light he needed on that very
useful subject for operating upon&mdash;the
key-hole.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 568px;">
<img src="images/i_275a.jpg" width="568" height="572" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>A PHOSPHORUS LANTERN.</p></div>
</div>

<p>There is one other method of gaining
light. This is by means of a piece of wax
candle stuck in a square bit of yellow soap.</p>

<p>Perhaps the jemmy is the most popular
burglar's tool with which the public are
on disagreeably familiar terms. They can
supply you with any size at New Scotland
Yard. Here you have a pretty little group
of eight large "jemmies"&mdash;all of which
are used for safe-breaking purposes. They
are all made of the best steel. This extra
long one&mdash;it measures 3ft.&mdash;is called
"The Lord Mayor," whilst its two next
sized ones are dubbed "The Alderman"
and "Common Councilman." It is a
significant fact, which has never been
satisfactorily explained, that the members
of the fraternity of which we are now
treating go to the City for names for their
jemmies. Possibly some of them may have
uncomfortable recollections of the Mansion
House, and thus take revenge on the Lord
Mayor and his colleagues by using them&mdash;in
the shape of jemmies&mdash;for burglarious
purposes!</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 414px;">
<img src="images/i_275b.jpg" width="414" height="624" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>EIGHT LARGE JEMMIES</p></div>
</div>

<p>The smaller jemmies are for housebreaking.
One of these&mdash;made out of an old
file&mdash;is robed in a cloth case; another
unscrews in the centre, so as to be more
readily carried. Another is a packing-case
opener, such as is used in Covent Garden
every day for prising open boxes of fruit.
Many are the ways adopted for carrying
these. It is generally believed by the
authorities that in the conveying of burglars'
tools cabmen are often in league with the
offending parties. A cabman going through
the streets at night can jog along unnoticed,
especially if a lady and gentleman in evening
dress are inside.</p>

<p>There is a record at New Scotland Yard of
a burglar stealing a four-wheeler from a rank
and driving the cab himself, with a friend
inside with the tools. Tools have been
carried in hat-boxes, carpenters' baskets, and
even in a silk hat on the head. Peace, the
king of all burglars, frequently carried the
implements of his craft in a violin case&mdash;but
of this worthy more anon. The general rule
is to carry jemmies down the leg of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
trousers or up the sleeve; whilst other tools
are smuggled into long pockets of the
"rabbit" pattern, such as used by the
old-time poachers.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most remarkable place in which
a burglar carried his tools was a euphonium!
However, he succeeded in passing through
the City as a "wait," and made a fairly good
profit out of the night's proceedings. It is
not on record whether the constable on point
wished him "a merry Christmas" or not.</p>

<p>We are inclined to tell a story which we have
every reason to believe to be perfectly true.
It was told to the writer by a burglar. The
burglar stated that in country "affairs" it is
always deemed wise to hide the tools to be
used somewhere near to the spot to be
operated upon, and not to carry them about
the person. He had hidden his tools in a
hedge in the morning. When he arrived in
the afternoon to get them&mdash;previous to setting
out for the scene of the burglary&mdash;he found
them gone. Whilst hunting around, he noticed
some children romping about in an adjoining
field. One little bright-eyed lassie saw him,
and leaving her companions, ran up to him
and said, in childlike way: "Please, sir, I've
found this." "This" was the burglar's tools
tied up in a piece of black cloth. The little
girl was rewarded with sixpence.</p>

<p>Of skeleton keys there is a very admirable
selection at New Scotland Yard. They
are made both of iron and steel&mdash;mostly
of scrap-iron, as it is tougher and has
no grain in it. Burglars and housebreakers
usually make their own skeleton keys&mdash;some
of which are very rough. The key is bought
in the block, and the wards are cut out as
needed. Those shown are of two kinds.
The bunch consists of "pick-locks," which are
made of stout wire. A housebreaker has been
caught with as many as thirty of these pick-locks
in his possession. For larger locks, the
keys are much stronger. This pretty little
cloth case was found on a gentleman. These
would be used for opening heavy doors.
Of those shown it will be noticed that all
save two are made with the wards to both
ends. There can be no doubt as to the
efficacy of skeleton keys, and lever locks are
strongly recommended to the wise, as it
would be impossible to open one with a
"skeleton."</p>

<p>We now come to the wedges&mdash;apparently
very small, but incalculably important items
in the particular branch of art with which we
are now dealing. Wedges may be either of
wood or steel, and are used for driving under
doors whilst working in a room. They are
usually held tight to the floor by a gimlet, so
that if the housebreakers were disturbed and
an attempt was made to open the door, the
more the opposing party was to push outside,
the tighter the door would be held. The
only hope would be to force the door and
the thieves in nine cases out of ten would
have ample opportunity to get away.</p>

<p>You may find at Scotland Yard the mahogany
leg of a parlour chair, with a number of
wedges by its side, which tells a story of
ingenuity as clever
as anything of its
kind ever conceived
by any
novelist. More
than that, it reflects
the greatest credit
upon the skill of
our detectives and
police officials.
These simple,
harmless-looking
little wedges were
quite sufficient to
get three men
twenty years' penal
servitude for burglary.
It was in
1875. A number
of burglaries were
committed in a
certain district in
London. The
almost invariably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
careful perpetrators were foolish on these
particular occasions, for they left their wedges
behind them. These were, however, treasured
by the police. When the men were eventually
arrested, it was found that a chair at their
lodgings was minus a leg, and when the
wedges were pieced together&mdash;hey, presto!
here was the mahogany leg! There are
other exhibits at New Scotland Yard equally
interesting&mdash;simple
little items
which tell a big
story and carry
with them heavy
punishments. In
a case is a group
of articles comprising
a number
of bullets, a
wooden wedge, a
truncheon
case&mdash;showing bullet
marks&mdash;a soft
black felt hat,
and two chisels.
Above the case is
an enlarged photo
of one of the
chisels. They are
relics of the murder
of Police-constable
Cole, on
December 1, 1882,
by Thomas Henry
Orrocks. Orrocks
left behind him, in
a turning out of
Dalston Lane,
where the affray
took place, the old
hat, the wooden
wedge, and the two
chisels. He was
suspected. The
discovery was
made that he had
been practising
with a revolver
at Tottenham
Marshes, and a
bullet found in a
tree there was identical
with those
found in the constable's
truncheon
case. But the most
convincing evidence
was the fact
that when the
chisels were photographed the word "Rock"
was found scratched near the handle. It is
a fact, not generally known, that photography
can render visible what the eye is quite
unable to discern. It was sufficient to hang
Thomas Henry Orrocks.</p>

<p>Perhaps, however, the button incident is
the prettiest of all. What a warning to burglars!
The relics consist of an old black<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
overcoat with a broken bone button. The
piece broken off is carefully preserved in a
small wooden box. In January,
1874, a burglary was committed in
the vicinity of Westminster. A little
piece of freshly broken off bone
button was foolishly left on the
window-sill. This the police kindly
and considerately took charge of.
A man was suspected, but there
was no evidence against him to justify
an arrest. But an enterprising police-officer
clung to that bit of button,
and one night he chanced to come
across a gentleman with a button
that had a piece missing.</p>

<p>"Halloa!" he exclaimed, "button
broken, eh?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the proprietor of
the old black overcoat, "I've lost it.
I don't know where it is."</p>

<p>"I know," said the calculating
detective. "Here it is! Why, bless
me, it just fits, my friend!"</p>

<p>Some of the stolen property was
found in his pockets. The cap&mdash;we
mean the button&mdash;fitted. He
got three years!</p>

<p>Amongst the miscellaneous exhibits
at the New Yard is a piece
of wood cut out of a stable door
at Kensington. It is thick and
bulky; would take ten minutes or a
quarter of an hour to cut; and is
a good example of
the work done with
the ordinary stock
and centre-bit. It
is of sufficient size
to allow the hand
and arm to go
through comfortably,
so that the
bolt of the door
may be drawn
back. An artist's
palette knife is by
its side, which is
used for opening
window sashes. If
your housebreaker
found that he had
to deal with a
patent lock, he
would cut the
window pane, by
placing brown
paper over the
glass and working
over that, so that no noise is made. But it
may be mentioned that this is rarely done<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
now, as an entrance is usually effected
through the front door or trap-door in the
roof. It is a long time since the police have
had a case, however, where the panel of a
door has been cut, as it would too readily
betray the operation to the passer-by; the
more familiar method adopted now is to
work through an empty house, and so gain
an entrance.</p>

<p>An illustration is given of a lock of a safe
cut away by a ratchet. It is an ordinary
ratchet about 2ft. long. It is in reality a
common workman's tool, and is used every
day on palings in the streets. Such
an article as this is bought in any
ironmonger's shop. No up-to-date safe-breaker
would
ever think of
using such a tool
as this. The instrument
for cutting through
shutters is rather
more ingenious.
This is evidently
a home-made tool.
It is a steel-cutter,
and can be made
any size by moving
the centre-bit. A
knife is at each
end, being kept in
position by a long
screw. A hole
is made in the
shutter first, the
graduated screw
is inserted, and,
as this is driven
in, so the knives
cut their way. It
is surmised that
this shutter cutter
was not found to
answer the purpose
for which it
was intended, as
it is the only one
ever found by the
police. The other
specimen is for
wooden shutters&mdash;the
tridents being
so made that
whilst one cuts the
other scoops out.</p>

<p>The collection
of revolvers is
unique in its
way, and they are arranged about the walls of
the museum with a decided eye to effect. They
comprise weapons of every type and pattern.
The two specially selected which appear
above a very formidable dagger, evidently of
Eastern manufacture&mdash;have their own peculiar
history. The small one is the centre of
attraction amongst a strange group of relics,
consisting of a pair of links, the clasp of a
purse, a little piece of steel which fitted
inside a bracelet, and even a piece of a heel-tip.
The heel-tip corresponded with the
footprints of a suspected man, and, together
with the remains of the trinkets, helped to
bring a verdict of "Guilty." All these are
associated with the Muswell Hill burglary in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
January, 1889. The revolver
was used by one of three
men&mdash;who were all subsequently
sentenced to
penal servitude for life&mdash;for
shooting at Mr. Atkins.</p>

<p>The larger revolver&mdash;which
has an exceptionally
heavy central fire&mdash;belonged
to a top-hat shooter. On
July 18th, 1884, a burglary
was attempted at Hoxton.
The police chased the
burglars over the roofs of
the houses, and a worthy
named Wright, who had
attempted to make himself
look highly respectable in
a silk hat, amused himself
by clinging to a chimney-pot
with one arm and using
the other to practise firing
with&mdash;the targets being the
constables. Mr. Wright is
not likely to play at this
very risky pastime again.
He is Her Majesty's guest
for life in a palatial residence
specially constructed for
dispensing hospitality to
such gentlemen.</p>

<p>The life-preservers
are interesting. They
hang in a delicious
group just by the
window. They are
of all sorts and
sizes. One swings
on a piece of thick
cord heavily
loaded; another
is made of rhinoceros
hide. A
pretty little invention
in these
specialities
doubles up and
fits the waistcoat
pocket, the more
popular example
being made out
of a piece of cord
twisted round a
short cane with a
lead shot at both
ends. The life-preservers
have a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
curious companion&mdash;a pair of coverings,
very rudely made out of coarse linen, for
the feet, which the burglar puts over his
boots out of thoughtful consideration for
the slumbers of
his victims.</p>

<p>The disguises
used&mdash;and treasured
at New
Scotland Yard&mdash;chiefly
consist of
false whiskers and
beards. They are
all made of dark
cr&ecirc;pe hair and
fastened to wires,
which fit over the
ear and keep them
in position. The
most original idea
for concealing the
face, however, is
given a prominent
place near
the board on which are arranged the before-mentioned
complete set of tools. It consists
of a hard, black hat, attached to which is a
piece of black American cloth with openings
to give sight, cut very much to the size of
old-fashioned goggles. This is fastened round
the chin with a piece of cord.</p>

<p>Its wearer was a most unfortunate individual,
and there is every reason to believe
that he has the warm sympathy of all his
brother professionals. He was "specially
engaged" on a public-house in the New
North Road after closing time. He was
found under a bed, and hurried to get away,
being most determinedly chased by the energetic
landlord. The owner of the black
billycock, fancying he saw a means of escape,
made for a window. But his patent hat and
face protector served him a shabby trick.
The man only
saw a window and
not the iron bars,
between a couple
of which his head
lodged as though
specially designed
for the purpose.</p>

</div>

<p>We now come
to the most artistic kind of burglar&mdash;the
portico thief, the man who goes in for great
things in the
way of jewellery.
There
are many exhibits
at the
museum used
in this special
branch of
burglary&mdash;rope
ladders,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
treadles, strings, coils of copper wire,
gimlets, wedges, woollen stockings to go over
boots, etc. The rope ladders, known as
"slings," are often 25ft. and 30ft. long, and
are made with rope treads just sufficient to
put the foot in. A hook is at the end,
which is lodged on some convenient support
strong enough to hold the weight of the
man ascending. They are generally carried
by winding them about the body.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 330px;">
<img src="images/i_283a.jpg" width="330" height="235" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>PEACE'S OUTFIT.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The wire, string, wedges, socks, etc., in the
illustration were found
at Ealing when the
men escaped. They
had "wired" the
house and grounds all
over. This is done in
order that, if they are
chased, the wires,
which are placed at
ankle height, trip the
pursuer up, the thieves
themselves knowing
of their whereabouts
by putting a piece of
white paper in their
immediate vicinity.</p>

<p>These are the
simple appliances of
your truly artistic
burglar&mdash;the man who
has been laying his
plans for months, the
individual who will
pay a hundred visits
to the house before
he brings about
his grand <i>coup</i>,
who will know
the value of every
piece of jewellery
the ladies are
wearing at the
dinner-table, and
be fully aware of
the exact place
where to lay his
wily fingers on
them in the
dressing-room.</p>

<p>This is the
class of men
who are the
greatest trouble
to the police&mdash;these
are the
best customers
of the receivers.
Frequently a man
is employed to do all the planning and
mapping out for the party who will do
the actual job. For this he is paid a certain
price or perhaps a commission on the
results of the robbery. This person will
draw up a plan of the house as true&mdash;though
perhaps not quite as artistic&mdash;as
any architect. But he gives the thief
the very information he needs, and
puts on the map of the house and grounds
the exact position where the operator must
"beware of the dog."
A man named Connor
is credited at New
Scotland Yard with
being one of the finest
adepts at this particular
work of all
which have come
under their notice.
He used to lecture
on this peculiar art
to young thieves, and
whilst in prison wrote
a work giving them
practical advice on
the subject. The
prison officials allowed
him to finish his
literary effort, and
when his time expired
coolly appropriated
the same.</p>

<p>No article dealing
even in a small way
with "Burglars and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
Burgling" would be complete without
some reference to "The King," and the
relics of this talented individual are of a
highly interesting character. Charles Peace
thoroughly deserved to be crowned king of
all burglars, housebreakers, and scoundrels in
general. Peace always worked single-handed.
He had no "receiver," and melted down all his
own stuff and sold it as a matter of business.
All his stock-in-trade is to be found at the
museum. His tools are only ten in number,
and comprise a skeleton key, two pick-locks,
a centre-bit, a large gimlet, a gouge, a chisel,
a small vice (for turning keys on the outside
of doors&mdash;used when people leave the key
in the lock), a jemmy (about 2ft. long),
and a knife. With these Peace worked.
His blue spectacles and case are not
missing. These he used for purposes of
disguise, though when arrested at Blackheath
his face was stained with walnut-juice,
in the hopes of passing off as a Mulatto.</p>

<p>His ladder was quite a unique arrangement.
When doubled up it is to all outward
appearances simply a bundle of blocks of
wood such as any carpenter might carry
home for firewood. But it opens out to a
length of some 13ft., working on a bolt, with
a hole at one end to hook on to a nail in the
wall, and so complete facilities were afforded
for climbing to window or veranda. In
addition to his tools he called into requisition
a pony and trap at night. He
practically killed the pony with hard work.</p>

<p>The crucible in which he did his melting
down is of clay, and was found at Peckham.
Its interior is much scorched. It is about
6in. deep inside, and the diameter of the
orifice is 4in. Peace was truly magnificent
in all he undertook&mdash;in his own peculiar
profession he positively arose to greatness.
In the midst of his burglaries he kept up
a fine house at Peckham, with two housekeepers
and a servant. His drawing-room
suite was worth sixty guineas, a Turkey carpet
was laid on the floor, gilded mirrors decorated
the walls, and on the grand piano was a
beautifully inlaid Spanish guitar worth some
thirty guineas. He lived the life of an
independent gentleman. He was passionately
fond of music, and on the night of the
attempted robbery at Blackheath he had an
at-home concert, and whilst one housekeeper
played the piano and another sang, Charles
joined in with the violin.</p>

<p>His audacity was such that at the time his
name was on everybody's lips, and Scotland
Yard was full of him, he visited the Yard
disguised as a clergyman and asked a number
of questions about himself!</p>

<p>His false arm was a unique idea. He was
minus the fore-finger of the left hand, and
after he left Sheffield on 29th November,
1876, his description was posted at every
police-station in the country. So he made
himself this arm which he placed in his sleeve,
hanging his violin on the hook when engaged
in walking about and taking stock of
"crackable" residences, and screwing in a
fork in the place of the hook for use at
meals. So for something like two years the
irrepressible Peace walked this earth short of
a <i>hand</i>, whilst the police were looking for a
man short of a <i>finger</i>!</p>

<h2><a name="Lost" id="Lost"><span class="smcap">Lost
in a
Blizzard</span></a></h2></div>
</div>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By G. H. Lees</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[<i>The following is an absolutely true narrative of actual facts, and was written down from Mr. Lees' dictation,
the loss of both his hands, of course, precluding him from writing.</i>]</p></div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_285.png" width="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">On</span> Christmas morning, 1886, I
started about ten o'clock
from Indian Head, Manitoba,
Canada, with Her Majesty's
mail, to travel forty miles. It
was a very cold morning, and
blowing 30&deg; below zero. I had been on my
journey about an hour, when I began to feel
very sleepy, through the intense cold, and so
got out to walk for a time. The storm
increased so that I could not see twenty
yards before me, but I still kept the trail
till something happened to the harness. I
threw my gloves into the sleigh while I put
it right, hanging the reins on the front board.</p>

<p>When I went back to get in, the ponies
bolted, leaving me without gloves. I ran
some distance, when the cold seemed to
make me faint; I lay down an hour before
I could recover myself sufficiently to start
again; when I did, both hands were frozen
stiff.</p>

<p>The blizzard cleared, and when I had
thawed my eyes (which were frozen up with
the drifting snow) I could see a shanty
about a mile off the trail. I started to it, but
bad luck attended me. When I reached it,
it was uninhabited, and my hands were so
frozen that I could not move a finger to
get in, so sat down in a shed to consider
what would be best to do.</p>

<p>Feeling perished as my feet began to freeze,
I was obliged to walk on. I saw another
place I knew across the prairie, about two
miles from where I stood, and started for it
as well as I could get along, but still worse
luck attended me. I had gone only half my
journey when the blizzard increased, so that
it froze my eyes up and nearly choked me.
I turned my back to the storm and tried to
retrace my footsteps, but the snow had completely
swept them out; and I was lost, as I
thought, for ever.</p>

<p>I walked on, both sore and hungry, but
dared not sleep, knowing it would mean
death; but could see nothing. As night
came on the blizzard abated, but it was no
help to me when darkness had set in. I
knew it meant that I must walk or die.</p>

<p>Suffering now with hunger and thirst, I ate
some snow, but every time I took it, it
pulled the skin off my lips. I walked on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
until I was completely played out, falling
down some twenty times, sometimes seven
or eight feet, and it took me some time to
recover myself, not being able to use my
hands, and afraid they would break; my
elbows, too, began to feel sore, through the
frost and falls. Once or twice I followed a
bright star, thinking it might be a light in a
shanty; it seemed about on a level with the
snow.</p>

<p>I had been walking until about midnight,
when I fell down a bank about ten feet
right into the snow, where I thought I
should lay and die. I had a Scotch collie
with me, and he curled up close and kept
me warm. I think I must have
slept a little time, as the dog
was howling when I awoke. I
was very stiff, and struggled
more than an hour to get up
the embankment. When at the
top I was on the open plain,
and my dog was gone. The
moon was shining, and I walked
on to a wood, which sheltered
me a little from the cold. I
was very hungry now, as I had
been walking twenty hours without
food, and, being famished,
I had to bite the snow off the
trees, though it pulled the skin
off my lips.</p>

<p>Then I lay down again for
a time. Presently my dog came
back, and I was very pleased to
see him, thinking anything to
die with was better than being
alone. He left me again in the
night; his feet were freezing,
and he was howling with pain;
but came back again when it
was getting light, lying down
as if he were dead.</p>

<p>I got on to a trail, and
thought I should find some
shanty. I left my dog, thinking
he was dying. The trail ended,
and now came my trial. I had
to clamber through the wood where it
had been burnt a few years before by
the dreaded prairie fire, the trees that
had fallen and not been burnt lying on
the ground, so that I had to clamber over
them, often falling and with great difficulty
getting up.</p>

<p>At last I got on the prairie again, but
the blizzard was worse than ever, the
temperature being now 40&deg; below zero. Walking
on about a mile I came to a haystack.
Thinking there might be a shanty near, but
not finding one, I lay down by the side of
the stack. I should think this would be
about seven o'clock.</p>

<p>After lying a little time I thought I would
go back again to my dog and die with him
in the wood. I had not gone more than
three parts of the way before he met me,
barking with delight. I followed him
through the wood until we came to a
steep hill, impossible for me to walk
up; but the dog kept trying to make me
start. I crawled on my elbows, as I was now
afraid of breaking my hands to pieces. They
were like glass. I had got on nicely for about
fifty yards, the dog licking my face, when I
slipped back about twenty yards. It must
have taken me half an hour to get to the top,
but when I got there what joy it was to see a
shanty and people in it!</p>

<div class="caption"><p>"BARKING WITH DELIGHT."</p></div>
</div>

<p>I was helpless after I got into the warmth
for a little time, but soon knew I must try
to save my hands and arms. The people
were very good, helping in every way to save
them, getting me a pail of cold water, in
which I held them for twelve hours. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
ice came out in balls; but it was of no use.
The good lady fed me; trying to ease the
pain as much as she could. My eyes,
too, were dreadful; she laid cold tea-leaves
on them, which I believe saved me
much pain.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>"THEY WRAPPED MY HANDS IN PARAFFIN RAGS."</p></div>
</div>

<p>They removed my boots and socks as
quickly as they could, and cut the feet to let
the blood out. After I had been lying with
my hands in the water so long they took me
and laid me on the bed near the stove,
and wrapped my hands in paraffin rags.
They could not send for the doctor that day,
as the blizzard was so bad. After lying in
this state for two days he came, but said he
could do no good to me there, but I must go
to Quappelle, about twenty miles away.</p>

<p>My friends drove me to Indian Head, but
I was very sore, their sleigh not being long
enough to lie at length in it. After this
other friends carried me to the hotel
and fed me, whilst the rest got a waggon
and put it on sleighs with a spring
mattress and rugs, and started me on my
journey again.</p>

<p>I went on comfortably for the next ten
miles, when I arrived at the Leeland Hotel,
where six men carried me upstairs on a
blanket. I lay here seven days, Doctor
Edwards and the manager of the hotel doing
all they could for me. The students from
the college used to come and sit up with me.
Doctor Edwards told me I must have both
hands taken off, if not one foot, so I
thought it best to go to the General Hospital,
Winnipeg.</p>

<p>I started on January 3rd, at half-past three
o'clock in the morning, arriving at Winnipeg
at half-past six o'clock at night, being taken
from the station in a fly, and admitted about
seven o'clock. After having a nice warm
bath, I was put to bed, receiving every attention.
I had as many as eight doctors to see
me, but they gave up my hands as hopeless.
On the 23rd of January they took them
both off, about two inches above my wrists.
I was in bed eleven weeks, and Nurse
Reynolds attended and dressed my arms all
the time.</p>

<p>I left Winnipeg on April 1st, going West to
some friends until strong enough to return
home. My fare was paid to Liverpool,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
and I started the 3rd of June, stopping
to see the nurse on Sunday, when I met
an old mate who was in the hospital all
the time with me to have his big toe taken
off. He fed me, sleeping with me to dress
me. His name was Tom Collett; he put me
on the train Sunday night, and I arrived at
Quebec on Wednesday night, late. I stayed
with French people at the hotel and found it
very comfortable.</p>

</div>

<p>In the morning I went on to the Allan Liner
<i>Sardinian</i>, when we left Quebec about 12
o'clock a.m. I had an intermediate ticket: it
was quite as good as first-class. The captain
sent a sailor to look after me; he dressed,
fed, and attended to me in every way
he possibly could. We had a good voyage,
arriving at Liverpool on the Saturday before
Jubilee Day, but too late to send a telegram
home. The sailor saw me in the train at
Liverpool at eleven o'clock at night, and I
reached London about four o'clock next
morning, where a policeman showing me a
waiting-room, I slept until seven o'clock,
after which I had refreshment, leaving King's
Cross at once, and reaching home at eleven
o'clock, having been away from England one
year and a half.</p>

<h2><a name="The_British_Embassy_at_Paris" id="The_British_Embassy_at_Paris"><i>The British Embassy at Paris.</i></a></h2>


<h3><span class="smcap">By Mary Spencer-Warren.</span></h3>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_289.png" width="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> post of Ambassador at
Paris being the plum of the
Diplomatic service, its attainment
is the hope and aim of
many a statesman; but, skilful
though he may have proved
himself, brilliant though his services to his
country may have been, he is fortunate
indeed if his aspirations are ever realized.
It is quite conclusive, however, that he who
<i>is</i> appointed is a man of sterling merit: and
such is the present Ambassador; and most
of us can recall the satisfaction with which
both political parties hailed his succession.</p>

<p>I have had several opportunities of visiting
the Embassy in the Rue du Faubourg Saint
Honor&eacute;, but certainly the most interesting
occasion was the first one, that being the
wedding day of Lord Terence Blackwood,
the second son, to Miss Davis, of New York.</p>

<p>I am early on the scene, so have ample
time to linger at the massive gates, and
looking across the courtyard, study the front
exterior.</p>

<p>It is a house with a history; for back in the
days when Buonaparte was seeking to make
himself master of
the world, his
sister, the Princess
Pauline, was its
occupant. Beautiful
as this Princess
was, one can easily
imagine the house
to have been the
rendezvous of the
fashionable inhabitants
of a
fashionable city;
although, if report
speaks truly, such
assemblies were
composed more
largely of the gay
than the wise. A
change of ownership
came, for in
1814 it was purchased
by the
British Government;
and from
being a resort for
the idle, it became
one of the business centres of Paris.
Now we pass the porter's lodge and the
offices of the Consulate, and mount the broad
steps into the portico. Just now all this presents
quite a tropical appearance; stately palm,
waving fern, and choice flowers being placed
for the occasion. Stepping into the entrance
halls, inner and outer, I find a continuance
of the floral decorations, making the place
look a veritable fairyland. Ionic columns,
marble walls, and marble stairs lend themselves
for a grand background to this Oriental
display, here and there peeping out, costly
but not lovely, Burmese idols, elephants' feet,
a model of Mandalay, a Pith village, and other
valuable curios. Tables with rich Oriental
covers, settees and chairs in rich crimson
velvet, give colour, making altogether a fine
picture.</p>

<p>I am almost immediately joined by Lady
Dufferin and her two daughters, and much
pleasant talk ensues, and a leisurely survey
of some hundreds of costly wedding presents.</p>

<p>A chat with any of this family is an intellectual
treat; so much can they tell one of
people and places, and so many and varied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
are the leaves from their eventful lives. Also,
the residence is an interesting study. One
sees in it so many reminders from friends in
all parts: testimonies of esteem and regard
bestowed by illustrious donors, and pleasant
little reminders come with them all&mdash;a little
anecdote of this individual, and a little story
connected with that place.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>GRAND STAIRCASE.</p>

<p><i>From a Photo. by Gunn &amp; Stuart, Richmond.</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>Together we make the tour of the principal
rooms, halting every now and again for
anything of special interest, such as water-colours
by His Excellency, paintings and
miniatures collected by him on his foreign
stations, furniture and plate formerly the
property of the Napoleon family, and the
exquisite floral
decorations of the
suite of rooms set
apart for the reception
in American
style which is to
take place after the
ceremony.</p>

</div>

<p>Here we are
presently joined
by the Marquis
and the bridegroom&mdash;Lord
Terence Blackwood&mdash;together
with his two younger brothers; we
all turn again to the still arriving
presents, everybody laughing and
talking together in an unaffected
and happy manner. Evidently the
coming event affords complete satisfaction
to this thoroughly typical
English family; but time is getting
on, the sight of the men in their
gorgeous State liveries of blue and
gold, powdered wigs, and pink silk
stockings warns each and all of
preparations to be made, so we disperse
for the present, to meet many
times later in the day, and also on
subsequent occasions.</p>

<p>Then I wander about at my own
will and pleasure, and make myself
more thoroughly acquainted with
the house and its contents.</p>

<p>The Throne Room and Ball
Room are contiguous, only divided
by an archway spanned by a double
brest-summer supported by carved
figures. In the Throne Room,
Lord Dufferin, of course, represents
the Majesty of Great Britain; and
though the number of English
residents in Paris is comparatively
few since the fall of the Monarchy and the
rise of the Republic, yet there is still a fair
number of influential families, and also
many foreign friends of the British Crown,
who, together with the representatives of
other Courts, make up a crowded assembly
and form a brilliant gathering. Different
receptions, these, to some I was told of&mdash;some
in India and others in Canada. Very
peculiar and highly amusing: perhaps the
first one given in Canada excelled in this
respect. Owing to delay in arrival of luggage,
the family were very, very short of even
such necessary articles as crockery, managing
amongst themselves with about half-a-dozen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
cracked plates and cups. More must be got
somewhere for the reception, which would
doubtless be large, so they had to borrow,
not priceless S&egrave;vres or dainty Dresden, but
thick earthenware, pure and simple. The
entire affair was what we should call
"scratch"&mdash;the bed had to be moved
out of the best bed-chamber to make more
room; the furniture itself was all "lodging-house."
When the company arrived
many of them had no cards; the servant
could not say their French names, so made
them write them on bits of paper at the
entrance; and, to crown it all, just as it was
all over, the servants of the crockery owners
came and fetched it away,
right in sight of the guests!</p>

<p>And yet they were very
merry over all these affairs&mdash;merry
even when they
had to oil themselves all
over with strong smelling oil
to keep off the bites of the
mosquitoes. And then what
outings they had in this
same place! How they all
went on fishing expeditions;
camping out in tents, which
had to be entered by creeping
in on all fours through
a very small hole; then
sleeping with a knife under
their pillows, so as to cut
another way out if a bear
should look in! One occasion
Lady Dufferin recalls,
when, on crawling
into her tent in the usual
manner, she made a false
movement and the entire
affair upset on top of her!
Canadian life had its drawbacks,
but it had its pleasures,
not the least of them
being the large circle of
friends made by the
Governor-General and his
wife; and it is difficult to
say on which side was the
most regret at parting&mdash;the
Dufferin family or the inhabitants
of the country.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>LORD DUFFERIN IN HIS STUDY.</p>

<p><i>From a Photo. by Gunn &amp; Stuart, Richmond.</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>Then the reminiscences
go away to India, where
everything was done on a
scale of gorgeous magnificence;
where such a reception
awaited them on
their arrival as completely
eclipsed anything they had ever before
witnessed; where vast crowds of Europeans
and natives of every size and shape lined the
streets to give them greeting: some in all the
colours of the rainbow, some in "nearly
nothing at all." Here the Residence was
grand and stately, swarming with native
servants in any number of different costumes:
some in glittering uniforms, some in ordinary
dress, and some in rags and tatters; but
men, all men, for every possible duty, and
all of them extremely mindful of caste. He
who puts water into your jug would not
deign to pour it out; one who cleans your
shoes would consider it derogatory to pass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
you a cup of tea; one puts a candle in a
candlestick, another sets light to it. At any
time you need not be surprised at finding as
many as eight men in your bedroom, all
gravely performing their different duties!</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 362px;">

<div class="caption"><p>LADY DUFFERIN.</p>

</div>

<p>Then the receptions of Indian potentates
by Lord Dufferin, when, in accordance with
the rank of each, so many <i>aides-de-camp</i>
must fetch them from their residences, and
so far must His Excellency advance to meet
them: anywhere from half-way down the
room to the steps at the entrance.</p>

<p>Then they all sat about in various positions,
some of the time silent, some of it talking
with the aid of interpreters; occasionally
varying proceedings by offering presents
which they did not mean them to accept&mdash;Lady
Dufferin and others of the family
enjoying a private view from a safe hiding-place.</p>

<p>Somewhat embarrassing must have been
the situation of Lord Dufferin and his
attach&eacute;s when attending for the first time
an Indian organized entertainment. It was
in the morning, and they were duly arrayed
in orthodox frock-coat. Much to their consternation,
wreaths of flowers were brought
forward and placed around their necks! Just
you imagine such a picture here! I am
afraid it would be too much for even the
gravity of grave Englishmen!</p>

<p>At Paris things are done in lavish style,
be it dinner party for forty to sixty, or garden
party attended by fourteen or fifteen hundred;
the wedding reception, for instance,
bringing several hundreds of the <i>&eacute;lite</i> of the
city, the entire ground suite of rooms being
thrown open, in addition to the fine covered
promenade gallery, with orange trees, palms,
etc., which forms a terrace opening on to
grounds in the rear of the house.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>LADY HERMIONE BLACKWOOD.</p>

<p><i>From a Photo. by Gunn &amp; Stuart, Richmond.</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>This brings me back to the Throne Room,
where I commenced to speak of receptions.
This room is somewhat limited in size, but
the Ball Room joining more than redeems it,
as the two combined have the most magnificent
proportions. The walls are hung in
crimson, and show a profusion of plate-glass
panels; the ceiling is painted cream,
with gold relief, crystal chandeliers depend
from it; the whole being supported by
decorated Doric columns. The Throne<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
chair, on da&iuml;s and under a canopy, is of the
usual character, crimson upholstery and frame
of over-burnished gold; other furniture to
match, and all of it showing the Arms
of England and V.R., even the
carpet&mdash;an Axminster&mdash;having the
same design woven. Passing under
the archway into the Ball Room,
you step immediately on to a very
beautiful parquetry floor, and get a
clear view of the pretty lawn and
terraces, from windows facing&mdash;windows
handsomely curtained in
cream and gold. Ceiling and walls
alike are splendidly decorated in
relief, showing musical and armorial
designs; the furniture, settees, and
chairs to match with those in the
Throne Room.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 456px;">

<div class="caption"><p>THE THRONE ROOM.</p>

<p><i>From a Photo. by Gunn &amp; Stuart, Richmond.</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>Not only did I have the pleasure
of witnessing a reception and ball
in these rooms, but also attended
an assemblage of quite a different
character there on another occasion:
one of a description that tends very
much to make Lord and Lady
Dufferin the popular personages
they are; showing unmistakably their
interest in their less wealthy and less
fortunate countrymen and countrywomen.
This special meeting was
on behalf of the "Girls' Friendly
Society," the Paris branch of which
has a hard-working president in
Lady Dufferin. His Excellency not
only threw open his splendid rooms,
but also took the chair, and made a
hopeful, energetic speech, assuring
the society of his continual support.
I just mention this to show how
ready the family are to accord help
to those who need it, and to give
up time for the good of others, notwithstanding
the heavy pressure of
official and social duties devolving
upon them.</p>

<p>Thus the Embassy is the very
centre of much good work in the
city; how much is really done in
helping the needy, in suppressing
vice, protecting strangers, and supporting
charitable objects of all
sorts it would be impossible for me
to give you any idea.</p>

<p><i>From a Photo. by Gunn &amp; Stuart, Richmond.</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>Of Lord Dufferin's official life it
is not necessary to say much; his
appointment here was putting the
right man in the right place, such
satisfactory proof has he always given
of his splendid abilities, keen tact, and nicety
of judgment. More than one crisis has he
successfully tided over, earning the un<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>bounded
gratitude of his country. Few
men, perhaps, have held so many and
important positions under the Crown as he.
Born at Florence in 1826, he was educated
at Christ Church, Oxford; became a Lord-in-Waiting
to Her Majesty in 1849; went
with Lord Russell on a special mission to
Vienna in 1855; on a mission to Syria in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
1860; was made Lord-Lieutenant of County
Down in 1864: Under-Secretary of State for
India in 1864; Under-Secretary for War
in 1866; Chancellor and Paymaster for the
Duchy of Lancaster in 1868; Governor-General
of Canada in 1872; Ambassador to
St. Petersburg in 1879; to Constantinople in
1881; was sent on a Special Commission to
Egypt in 1882; was made Viceroy of India
in 1884; Ambassador to the King of Italy
in 1888; Ambassador at Paris in 1891.</p>

<p>In the Red Saloon many instances of the
artistic ability of Lord Dufferin may be seen:
indeed, the crimson-covered walls are profusely
hung with his water-colours. Amongst
others, I noticed the "Ruins of Fort Ticonderoga"
(where the 42nd Regiment was cut up),
the "Indian's Grave," "Artillery Ground at
Quebec," "Killyleagh Castle," and some descriptive
of the Iceland journey of his lordship.</p>

<p>While thinking of the Marquis of Dufferin
as a clever statesman, an artist, and a literary
man, it must not be forgotten that he is also
a very fine orator. His various speeches
make splendid reading: instructive, eloquent,
and always well to the point before him.
Perhaps there are no better of his on record
than those made in Canada, when the
rugged sons of toil who listened to him
went almost wild with delight. At that
time people had scarcely commenced to
settle in places which are now prosperous
cities and towns, and Lord Dufferin did
splendid service by visiting outlying regions
and pointing out possibilities of new commerce
and new sources of income.</p>

</div>

<p>The Queen's Room is very handsomely
decorated in blue and gold, and is one of the
suite of drawing-rooms on the ground floor;
it takes its name from a magnificent full-length
painting of Her Majesty. Buhl tables,
furniture of gold and silk brocade, ormolu
decorations, and carved marble combine to
make an exquisite display. As with the other
drawing rooms, it opens out on to the Promenade
Gallery.</p>

<p>The next room, called the Prince of Wales's
Room, is very handsome: it has a richly-decorated
ceiling in gold relief, with walls
draped and embellished to match; Ionic
columns and gold-framed panels to doors add
to the richness; cream silk curtains to the
windows, and quantities of white flowers
giving graceful relief to the gold blazonry of
furniture and carpet. The carpet, I may
mention, has the Prince of Wales's feathers
woven in the centre&mdash;from this the room is
named.</p>

<p>On the wedding day I was enabled to be
present at an American reception given in
this room. Furniture was all cleared out and
every niche filled with flowers, with wreaths
of same round every picture and panel; a
da&iuml;s was erected at
the top, and on it
stood Lord and
Lady Terence
Blackwood on
their return from
church, everybody
who attended walking
up to shake
hands and congratulate,
then
walking off to find
their way to the
well-spread tables
for "five o'clock
tea." Lord and
Lady Dufferin
and family mingled
with the crowd,
talking to everybody;
and though
the bride and bridegroom
must have
been tired with
standing so long,
and shaking hands with so many, yet the
whole affair was a deal more enjoyable
than the formal breakfast, with the nervous
speeches of the nervous men.</p>

<p>Of course, I congratulated the happy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
couple on behalf of <span class="smcap">The Strand Magazine</span>,
and of course I carried away a piece
of <i>the</i> cake, one of the inimitable Buszard's,
all glorious in silver decorations of flowers,
fruit, Irish harps, etc., and mounted on a
massive silver stand. For the benefit of my
lady readers, I may remark that the bride
was really beautiful (people generally say
they <i>look</i> so, but this one really <i>was</i>); cream
satin, Venice point, and orange blossom were
all in due order. But what chiefly interested
me was the crowd of celebrities present&mdash;Rothschilds,
Ambassadors (whose names are
known and honoured), some of the French
nobility, many familiar English faces, musical
and dramatic stars, etc.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>THE DINING-ROOM.</p>

<p><i>From a Photo. by Gunn &amp; Stuart, Richmond.</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>From here I proceed to the Dining Room,
a fine apartment lighted with crystal chandeliers
and silver-gilt candelabra, showing a
splendidly painted ceiling, with walls of
marble, carved oak, and crimson panels&mdash;these
being hung with shields and pieces of
armour, offensive and defensive. On the
tables is a fine display of plate, formerly the
property of Jerome Napoleon, a costly Burmese
bowl, and other pieces of presentation
plate too numerous to mention. I may here
say that upstairs in the strong-room I saw a
remarkably large collection of plate&mdash;some
belonging to the Embassy, but a great deal of
it the private property of the Marquis; all
was of the richest in quality and design, but
perhaps the gold Buddha from Burmah, a
Burmese cup&mdash;wonderfully chased&mdash;and some
candelabra, copied from originals found in
Pompeii, were of the greatest interest.</p>

<p>From here you can step out into the Inner
Hall, and then mount the splendidly wide
marble staircase, soon finding yourself in a
most beautiful suite of apartments.</p>

<p>The Second Red Saloon calls for your
particular attention: it has much in it worth
close study. The painted ceiling, brocaded
walls, and parquetry floors are elegant and
costly, and the furniture of the First Empire
worth more than passing note; but the chief
attraction undoubtedly is the unique collection
of Indian Rajahs, paintings on ivory;
these&mdash;seventy, I believe, in number&mdash;were
presented to His Excellency before leaving
India.</p>

<p>Nearly every one of the miniatures brings
up some interesting and may-be amusing
recollection, and carries the family back to
sojourns in various places: at Calcutta, for
instance, where Lady Dufferin tells with glee
how on one of her visits she was literally
garlanded with flowers, her pocket-handkerchief
copiously drenched with a pungent
scent, and a scented bouquet ornamented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
with tinsel thrust into her hands: thus
bedecked, she had to drive through the
streets, feeling, I should imagine, like a
central figure in a circus display. It seems it
was customary everywhere to make offerings
of flowers, fruit, cakes, and candy; and as these
latter were accepted and passed over to the
servants, they were
much delighted.
The rule regarding
other presents was
curious: jewellery,
etc., was accepted,
but passed on to
the Government
Treasury, sold,
and presents of
equal value returned
to the
donors: rather aggravating
this,
when a specially
nice article is
given. Money,
too, was often
offered, but this
was only touched,
not taken!</p>

<p>Then, again, reminders
crop up
of Burmah, some
not very pleasant
ones too, when the
bedrooms were
kept lively with
swarms of lizards,
and even scorpions
occasionally putting
in an unwelcome
appearance.
Or of Simla, where
a small Government
House was
perched at such a
dizzy height as
made falling over
a precipice a great
probability if venturing
too far over
the threshold:
a place where
carriages could not
get along, where
everybody had to
go out in "jinrikshas,"
a species
of Bath chair,
which was half
pulled and half
pushed by four and sometimes six men:
processions of them going along in single
file, the merry occupants shouting remarks
to the van or rear as they proceeded. Just
you imagine going to church on Sunday morning
in this fashion, or mounted on rough
ponies, horses, or anything on legs that could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
be obtained. Fancy what a nondescript congregation
it must be; occupants of jinrikshas,
ladies in riding gear with boots and
spurs complete, and black servants in every
colour of the rainbow.</p>

<p><i>From a Photo. by Gunn &amp; Stuart, Richmond.</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>One might go
on for any length
of time with these
reminiscences, but
there are a few
more rooms yet
unexplored.</p>

<p>The next one
I enter is known
as the Yellow
Saloon, nearly
everything in it
being gold and
cream. The ceiling
is painted
cream and decorated
in gold relief,
the walls are hung
with gold brocaded
silk, carpets and
curtains, settees
and chairs all in
character. On the
walls may be seen
some costly Italian pictures,
collected by Lord Dufferin, also a
few more miniatures of Rajahs. The
marble mantels in this suite of rooms
are also a special feature, so beautifully
are they carved; also you will
note the graceful crystal chandeliers
and parquetry floors.</p>

<p>On one side of the room you will
observe a very handsome silver-gilt
frame containing a portrait of the
Maharajah of Patiala, also a present.
Lord and Lady Dufferin were occasional
guests at this Prince's palace,
he entertaining them right royally,
even to providing bagpipe strains
for after-dinner performance, the
dusky pipers in Scottish attire, with
legs cased in pink silk to keep up
the semblance. I believe time and
tune were not much regarded, but
what mattered that? The intention
was good.</p>

<p>Opening from here is Lady
Dufferin's boudoir, a cosy apartment,
crowded with artistic and useful
pieces of furniture; music, books,
and family photographs abound;
and here Lady Dufferin finds time
for arrangement and direction of much of
the good work in which she is constantly
engaged.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 620px;">
<img src="images/i_299b.jpg" width="620" height="507" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>LORD DUFFERIN'S STUDY.</p>

<p><i>From a Photo. by Gunn &amp; Stuart, Richmond.</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>I may as well here state that Lady Dufferin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
is the daughter of the late Archibald R.
Hamilton, Esq., of Killyleagh Castle, Co.
Down; she has orders, the "Crown of
India," the "Victoria and Albert," the
"Crescent of the Shefkhat," and "Lion and
Sun." Wherever Lord Dufferin has been
appointed, there has Lady Dufferin worked
zealously for the welfare of the poorer classes,
but it is perhaps more especially for her
splendid work for the women of India that
she is so much honoured. Most of you know
the wretched condition of these poor women,
sufferers through the custom of the country.
Lady Dufferin, by her noble efforts for the
training of native women in medical skill, has
earned the gratitude and alleviated the misery
of thousands. The amount of correspondence
alone that all this entails upon her
ladyship is prodigious; every minute seems
to be fully occupied.</p>

<p>We take a peep into the next room, a
State bed-chamber. This, Lady Dufferin
tells me, was formerly used by the Princess
Pauline. Over the bed is displayed the
eagle, and the letter "P.," in ormolu, is on
much of the tulip, satinwood, and rosewood
furniture, all of which is covered with the
richest of brocades.</p>

<p>There is another room which must not be
omitted&mdash;Lord Dufferin's study. Thither
I proceed, and thus get a glance of the
enormous amount of business devolving upon
the Ambassador
and his secretaries.</p>

<p>Everything is of
the most orderly
in the arrangements:
all correspondence
sorted
up; papers and
books of reference
ready to hand;
well-filled bookshelves
containing
Parliamentary and
technical works,
and all the other
accessories of a
hard-working
Minister's room.
On the walls I
note a number of
family portraits,
chief of which are
Lady Dufferin and
Lord Ava&mdash;the
eldest son.</p>

<p>Of the real work
done here, few can
form any idea; communications from all parts
of the globe, arbitration here, intercession
there. Very much fine tact is wanted to keep
all this going smoothly: to uphold the majesty,
please the public, and give no manner of
offence. The multiplicity of affairs, some
trivial, some weighty&mdash;to an ordinary mind&mdash;would
be alarming. Not so long ago I was
in conversation with one, who, residing in a
town not far from Paris, had, as I think
deservedly, brought himself under the
vengeance of the French law; but he was
an English subject. "So," said he, "I shall
appeal to the Ambassador!" and appeal he
did. This just gave me an instance of the
number of petty matters that come for settlement
to the Embassy.</p>

<p>Downstairs is another room where any
amount of business is transacted, and where
I had a few minutes' chat with Austin Lee,
Esq., one of the secretaries; and opposite are
the offices of the Consulate. To one and
another there is a constant stream of people
from morning till night; all sorts and conditions,
and on all sorts of business. One thing
you may be sure of: no one who really needs
and deserves help or redress fails in obtaining
it; Lord Dufferin and his able assistants&mdash;whose
portraits are here presented&mdash;not only
conducting affairs of State with dignified
ability, but also giving ready sympathy of a
practical nature wherever required.</p>

<h2><a name="The_Birth_of_a_Smile" id="The_Birth_of_a_Smile"><i>The Birth of a Smile.</i></a></h2>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By a Photographer.</span></p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_306.png" width="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Some</span> people wonder why a
photographer charges extra
for taking infants in arms.
They imagine, perhaps, that a
photographer should conduct
his business on the principle
of the railway companies, and charge nothing
for infants and half-price for children under
twelve. But if the railway companies had as
much trouble with children as the photographer
has, they would charge double first-class
fare for those under twelve, and make
the infant in arms take a special train.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 201px;">
<img src="images/i_306a.jpg" width="201" height="310" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>1.</p></div>
</div>

<p>I am a photographer myself, although on
mature consideration I think I should prefer
to be a railway company. Of infants in
arms I prefer not to speak here&mdash;there might
even be a difficulty about printing some of the
things I should say. Suffice it to say that I
have a theory that Herod was a struggling
photographer in his young days, and had his
revenge when he came to the throne.
Intelligent children of half-fare age are bad
enough, but babies are beyond description.
Girls are not always satisfactory, but boys are
much worse. A boy turns up at a photographer's
in much the same frame of mind
that he visits the dentist&mdash;minus the terror.
He is so determined to see the thing through
with inflexible rigidity of countenance, that
the overwrought muscles of his face either
combine to give him an expression of intense
suffering, or else break down under the strain
and smudge the picture. It is always a doubtful
experiment to ask a boy to smile&mdash;you
never know what the result will be. Most
boys don't seem to know what a smile is.
It is best, instead of asking the boy to smile,
to provide something likely to make him do
it, and then have him photographed quickly
before the smile gets too wide for the plate.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 197px;">
<img src="images/i_306b.jpg" width="197" height="308" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>2.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Many old photographers will remember
Signor Berneri, a most admirable operator,
for many years with Messrs. Elliott and Fry.
Signor Berneri was an Italian, and his English
vocabulary was small. His invariable direction
to his sitters was, "Now, if you please&mdash;good
express!" There was a certain want of
definite clearness about this request, but by
the time the worthy Signor had taken a
ruinous number of negatives without achieving
the "express" he was aiming for, his
comic distress and inability to convey a
precise notion of what he required usually
worked their own cure, and the sitter was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
smiling as widely as anybody could
ask. An actual illustration of these
persevering attempts of Berneri is
to be seen on these pages, and
a gradually dawning perception
of the photographer's intention is
observable&mdash;and on the face of a
boy. The boy's original conception
of a "good express" is in the
nature of a compromise wherein
frowning determination mingles
with a guarded defiance.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 175px;">
<img src="images/i_307a.jpg" width="175" height="273" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>3.</p></div>
</div>

<p>After Berneri's usual "No good!
Bad express!" the boy modifies his
original notion, and stirs in a little dignified
truculence with the facial ingredients he used
at first. "Ah, no good&mdash;no good! Bad
express&mdash;more badder express!"&mdash;as one
can now almost hear the excitable Berneri
shouting. The boy abates his truculence,
and without altogether abandoning the
frown, tries a look of half-amused and
quite uncomprehending inquiry, which is,
perhaps, justified by the circumstances.
This, again, is "no good express," and by
this time the operator has grown impatient
and amusing; the boy begins actually to
smile; and at last there is a <i>real</i> smile&mdash;some
might say it verged on an amused grin. This
boy, by-the-bye, is now Mr. Elliott, jun.&mdash;still
of Elliott and Fry, and six feet six inches high.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 177px;">
<img src="images/i_307b.jpg" width="177" height="233" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>4.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Berneri has betaken himself to a well-earned
retirement in Italy&mdash;he retired, in
fact, some years ago. But, excellent operator
as he was, he will be remembered in the profession
for some time&mdash;if only because of
his wildly despairing entreaties for "Good
express&mdash;now, if you <i>please</i>&mdash;good express!"</p>

<p>But it is bad enough when your English is
of full vocabulary. Why is it no part of our
English boy's education to know what a
naturally pleasant expression of countenance
is? Why can he see no middle course
between an aspect of warlike grimness and a
self-conscious grin? I am thinking, seriously
thinking, of cultivating Signor Berneri's manner
and speech
for special use&mdash;with
boy sitters.
I may even spoil
more plates than
I do at present&mdash;although
that
is scarcely possible&mdash;but
the
smile&mdash;or grin&mdash;which
I extract
will, at least, be
intelligent, because
it will have
a definite object&mdash;myself.</p>

"Bartley <i>v.</i> Bartley and others,"

Crellan, solicitors for the plaintiff&mdash;a result
due entirely to the wonderful ability shown
in this case of building up, apparently out of
nothing, a smashing weight of irresistible
evidence. That the firm has since maintained&mdash;indeed,
enhanced&mdash;the position it
then won for itself, need scarcely be said here;
its name is familiar to everybody. But there
are not many of the outside public who know
that the credit of the whole performance was
primarily due to a young clerk in the employ
of Messrs. Crellan, who had been given
charge of the seemingly desperate task of
collecting evidence in the case.</p>

<p>This Mr. Martin Hewitt had, however,
full credit and reward for his exploit from his
firm and from their client, and more than one
other firm of lawyers engaged in contentious
work made good offers to entice Hewitt
to change his employers. Instead of this,
however, he determined to work independently
for the future, having conceived the
idea of making a regular business of doing,
on behalf of such clients as might retain him,
similar work to that he had just done, with
such conspicuous success, for Messrs. Crellan,
Hunt, and Crellan. This was the beginning
of the private detective business of Martin
Hewitt, and his action at that time has been
completely justified by the brilliant professional
successes he has since achieved.</p>

<p>His business has always been conducted
in the most private manner, and he has
always declined the help of professional
assistants, preferring to carry out, himself,
such of the many investigations offered him
as he could manage. He has always maintained
that he has never lost by this policy,
since the chance of his refusing a case begets
competition for his services, and his fees rise
by a natural process. At the same time, no
man could know better how to employ casual
assistance at the right time.</p>

<p>Some curiosity has been expressed as to
Mr. Martin Hewitt's system, and as he himself
always consistently maintains that he has
no system beyond a judicious use of ordinary
faculties, I intend setting forth in detail a
few of the more interesting of his cases, in
order that the public may judge for itself if I
am right in estimating Mr. Hewitt's "ordinary
faculties" as faculties very extraordinary
indeed. He is not a man who has made
many friendships (this, probably, for professional
reasons), notwithstanding his genial
and companionable manners. I myself first
made his acquaintance as a result of an accident
resulting in a fire at the old house in which
Hewitt's office was situated, and in an upper
floor of which I occupied bachelor chambers.
I was able to help in saving a quantity of
extremely important papers relating to his
business, and, while repairs were being made,
allowed him to lock them in an old wall-safe
in one of my rooms, which the fire had
scarcely damaged.</p>

<p>The acquaintance thus begun has lasted
many years, and has become a rather close
friendship. I have even accompanied Hewitt
on some of his expeditions, and, in a humble
way, helped him. Such of the cases, however,
as I personally saw nothing of I have
put into narrative form from the particulars
given me.</p>

<p>"I consider you, Brett," he said, addressing
me, "the most remarkable journalist
alive. Not because you're particularly clever,
you know; because, between ourselves, I
hope you'll admit you're not: but because
you have known something of me and my
doings for some years, and have never yet
been guilty of giving away any of my little
business secrets you may have become
acquainted with. I'm afraid you're not so
enterprising a journalist as some, Brett. But
now, since you ask, you shall write something&mdash;if
you think it worth while."</p>

<p>This he said, as he said most things, with
a cheery, chaffing good-nature that would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
have been, perhaps, surprising to a stranger
who thought of him only as a grim and
mysterious discoverer of secrets and crimes.
Indeed, the man had always as little of the
aspect of the conventional detective as may
be imagined. Nobody could appear more
cordial or less observant in manner, although
there was to be seen a certain sharpness of
the eye&mdash;which might, after all, only be the
twinkle of good-humour.</p>

<p>I <i>did</i> think it worth while to write something
of Martin Hewitt's investigations, and
a description of one of his adventures follows.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>At the head of the first flight of a dingy
staircase leading up from an ever-open portal
in a street by the
Strand stood a
door, the dusty
ground-glass
upper panel of
which carried in
its centre the
single word
"Hewitt," while
at its right-hand
lower corner, in
smaller letters,
"Clerk's Office"
appeared. On a
morning when
the clerks in the
ground-floor
offices had barely
hung up their
hats, a short,
well-dressed
young man,
wearing spectacles,
hastening to
open the dusty
door, ran into
the arms of
another man
who suddenly
issued from it.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 494px;">
<img src="images/i_309.jpg" width="494" height="598" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>MARTIN HEWITT.</p></div>
</div>

<p>"I beg pardon,"
the first
said. "Is this Hewitt's Detective Agency
Office?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I believe you will find it so," the
other replied. He was a stoutish, clean-shaven
man, of middle height, and of a
cheerful, round countenance. "You'd better
speak to the clerk."</p>

<p>In the little outer office the visitor was met
by a sharp lad with inky fingers, who
presented him with a pen and a printed slip.
The printed slip having been filled with the
visitor's name and present business, and
conveyed through an inner door, the lad
reappeared with an invitation to the private
office. There, behind a writing-table, sat
the stoutish man himself, who had only just
advised an appeal to the clerk.</p>

<p>"Good morning, Mr. Lloyd&mdash;Mr. Vernon
Lloyd," he said, affably, looking again at the
slip. "You'll excuse my care to start even
with my visitors&mdash;I must, you know. You
come from Sir James Norris, I see."</p>

<p>"Yes; I am his secretary. I have only
to ask you to go straight to Lenton Croft at
once, if you can, on very important business.
Sir James would have wired, but had not
your precise address. Can you go by the
next train?
Eleven-thirty is
the first available
from Paddington."</p>

<p>"Quite possibly.
Do you
know anything
of the business?"</p>

<p>"It is a case
of a robbery in
the house, or,
rather, I fancy,
of several robberies.
Jewellery
has been stolen
from rooms
occupied by
visitors to the
Croft. The first
case occurred
some months
ago&mdash;nearly a
year ago, in fact.
Last night there
was another. But
I think you had
better get the
details on the
spot; Sir James
has told me to
telegraph if you
are coming, so that he may meet you himself
at the station; and I must hurry, as his
drive to the station will be rather a long one.
Then I take it you will go, Mr. Hewitt?
Twyford is the station."</p>

<p>"Yes, I shall come, and by the eleven-thirty.
Are you going by that train yourself?"</p>

<p>"No, I have several things to attend to
now I am in town. Good morning; I shall
wire at once."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Martin Hewitt locked the drawer of
his table and sent his clerk for a cab.</p>

<p>At Twyford Station Sir James Norris was
waiting with a dog-cart. Sir James was a tall,
florid man of fifty or thereabout, known away
from home as something of a county historian,
and nearer his own parts as a great
supporter of the hunt, and a gentleman much
troubled with poachers. As soon as he and
Hewitt had found one another, the baronet
hurried the detective into his dog-cart.
"We've something over seven miles to drive,"
he said, "and I can tell you all about this
wretched business as we go. That is why I
came for you myself, and alone."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 493px;">
<img src="images/i_310.jpg" width="493" height="619" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"SIR JAMES NORRIS WAS WAITING WITH A DOG-CART."</p></div>
</div>

<p>Hewitt nodded.</p>

<p>"I have sent for you, as Lloyd probably
told you, because of a robbery at my place
last evening. It appears, as far as I can
guess, to be one of three by the same hand,
or by the same gang. Late yesterday
afternoon&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Pardon me, Sir James," Hewitt interrupted,
"but I think I must ask you to
begin at the first robbery and tell me the
whole tale in proper order. It makes things
clearer, and sets them in their proper shape."</p>

<p>"Very well. Eleven months ago, or
thereabout, I had rather
a large party of visitors,
and among them Colonel
Heath and Mrs. Heath&mdash;the
lady being a relative
of my own late wife.
Colonel Heath has not
been long retired, you
know&mdash;used to be political
resident in an Indian
native State. Mrs. Heath
had rather a good stock
of jewellery of one sort
and another, about the
most valuable piece being
a bracelet set with a particularly
fine pearl&mdash;quite
an exceptional pearl, in
fact&mdash;that had been one
of a heap of presents from
the Maharajah of his State
when Heath left India.</p>

<p>"It was a very noticeable
bracelet, the gold setting
being a mere featherweight
piece of native
filigree work&mdash;almost too
fragile to trust on the
wrist&mdash;and the pearl being,
as I have said, of a size
and quality not often seen.
Well, Heath and his wife
arrived late one evening,
and after lunch the following
day, most of the
men being off by themselves&mdash;shooting, I
think&mdash;my daughter, my sister (who is very
often down here), and Mrs. Heath took it
into their heads to go walking&mdash;fern-hunting,
and so on. My sister was rather long
dressing, and while they waited, my daughter
went into Mrs. Heath's room, where Mrs.
Heath turned over all her treasures to show
her&mdash;as women do, you know. When my
sister was at last ready they came straight
away, leaving the things littering about the
room rather than stay longer to pack them
up. The bracelet, with other things, was on
the dressing-table then."</p>

<p>"One moment. As to the door?"</p>

<p>"They locked it. As they came away my
daughter suggested turning the key, as we had
one or two new servants about."</p>

<p>"And the window?"</p>

<p>"That they left open, as I was going to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
tell you. Well, they went on their walk
and came back, with Lloyd (whom they had
met somewhere) carrying their ferns for
them. It was dusk and almost dinner time.
Mrs. Heath went straight to her room, and&mdash;the
bracelet was gone."</p>

<p>"Was the room disturbed?"</p>

<p>"Not a bit. Everything was precisely
where it had been left, except the bracelet.
The door hadn't been tampered with, but of
course the window was open, as I have told
you."</p>

<p>"You called the police, of course?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and had a man from Scotland Yard
down in the morning. He seemed a pretty
smart fellow, and the first thing he noticed
on the dressing-table, within an inch or
two of where the bracelet had been,
was a match, which had been lit and
thrown down. Now, nobody about the
house had had occasion to use a match in
that room that day, and, if they had, certainly
wouldn't have thrown it on the cover of the
dressing-table. So that, presuming the thief
to have used that match, the robbery must
have been committed when the room was
getting dark&mdash;- immediately before Mrs. Heath
returned, in fact. The thief had evidently
struck the match, passed it hurriedly over
the various trinkets lying about, and taken
the most valuable."</p>

<p>"Nothing else was even moved?"</p>

<p>"Nothing at all. Then the thief must
have escaped by the window, although it was
not quite clear how. The walking party
approached the house with a full view of
the window, but saw nothing, although the
robbery must have been actually taking place
a moment or two before they turned up.</p>

<p>"There was no water-pipe within any
practicable distance of the window. But a
ladder usually kept in the stable-yard was
found lying along the edge of the lawn.
The gardener explained, however, that he
had put the ladder there after using it himself
early in the afternoon."</p>

<p>"Of course, it might easily have been used
again after that and put back."</p>

<p>"Just what the Scotland Yard man said.
He was pretty sharp, too, on the gardener, but
very soon decided that he knew nothing of it.
No stranger had been seen in the neighbourhood,
nor had passed the lodge gates. Besides,
as the detective said, it scarcely seemed the
work of a stranger. A stranger could scarcely
have known enough to go straight to the
room where a lady&mdash;only arrived the day
before&mdash;had left a valuable jewel, and away
again without being seen. So all the people
about the house were suspected in turn. The
servants offered, in a body, to have their
boxes searched, and this was done; everything
was turned over, from the butler's to
the new kitchenmaid's. I don't know that I
should have had this carried quite so far
if I had been the loser myself, but it
was my guest, and I was in such a horrible
position. Well, there's little more to be
said about that, unfortunately. Nothing
came of it all, and the thing's as great a
mystery now as ever. I believe the Scotland
Yard man got as far as suspecting <i>me</i> before
he gave it up altogether, but give it up he
did in the end. I think that's all I know
about the first robbery. Is it clear?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; I shall probably want to ask a
few questions when I have seen the place,
but they can wait. What next?"</p>

<p>"Well," Sir James pursued, "the next was
a very trumpery affair, that I should have
forgotten all about, probably, if it hadn't
been for one circumstance. Even now I
hardly think it could have been the work of
the same hand. Four months or thereabout
after Mrs. Heath's disaster&mdash;in February of
this year, in fact&mdash;Mrs. Armitage, a young
widow, who had been a schoolfellow of my
daughter's, stayed with us for a week or so.
The girls don't trouble about the London
season, you know, and I have no town house,
so they were glad to have their old friend
here for a little in the dull time. Mrs.
Armitage is a very active young lady, and
was scarcely in the house half an hour before
she arranged a drive in a pony-cart with Eva&mdash;my
daughter&mdash;to look up old people in the
village that she used to know before she was
married. So they set off in the afternoon,
and made such a round of it that they were
late for dinner. Mrs. Armitage had a small
plain gold brooch&mdash;not at all valuable, you
know: two or three pounds, I suppose&mdash;which
she used to pin up a cloak or
anything of that sort. Before she went out
she stuck this in the pincushion on her
dressing-table, and left a ring&mdash;rather a good
one, I believe&mdash;lying close by."</p>

<p>"This," asked Hewitt, "was not in the
room that Mrs. Heath had occupied, I take
it?"</p>

<p>"No; this was in another part of the
building. Well, the brooch went&mdash;taken,
evidently, by someone in a deuce of a hurry,
for when Mrs. Armitage got back to her
room, there was the pincushion with a little
tear in it, where the brooch had been simply
snatched off. But the curious thing was that
the ring&mdash;worth a dozen of the brooch&mdash;was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
left where it had been put. Mrs. Armitage
didn't remember whether or not she had locked
the door herself, although she found it locked
when she returned; but my niece, who was indoors
all the time, went and tried it once&mdash;because
she remembered that a gasfitter was
at work on the landing near by&mdash;and found
it safely locked. The gasfitter, whom we
didn't know at the time, but who since seems
to be quite an honest fellow, was ready to
swear that nobody but my niece had been to
the door while he was in sight of it&mdash;which
was almost all the time. As to the window,
the sash-line had broken that very morning,
and Mrs. Armitage had propped open the
bottom half about eight or ten inches with a
brush; and when she returned, that brush,
sash and all, were exactly as she had left
them. Now, I scarcely need tell <i>you</i> what
an awkward job it must have been for anybody
to get noiselessly in at that unsupported
window; and how unlikely he would
have been to replace it, with the brush,
exactly as he found it."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 618px;">
<img src="images/i_312.jpg" width="618" height="417" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"I WAS TAKING A LITTLE PRACTICE."</p></div>
</div>

<p>"Just so. I suppose the brooch was really
gone? I mean, there was no chance of Mrs.
Armitage having mislaid it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, none at all. There was a most careful
search."</p>

<p>"Then, as to getting in at the window,
would it have been easy?"</p>

<p>"Well, yes," Sir James replied; "yes,
perhaps it would. It is a first-floor window,
and it looks over the roof and skylight of
the billiard-room. I built the billiard-room
myself&mdash;built it out from a smoking-room
just at this corner. It would be easy enough
to get at the window from the billiard-room
roof. But, then," he added, "that couldn't
have been the way. Somebody or other
was in the billiard-room the whole time, and
nobody could have got over the roof (which
is nearly all skylight) without being seen and
heard. I was there myself for an hour or
two, taking a little practice."</p>

<p>"Well, was anything done?"</p>

<p>"Strict inquiry was made among the
servants, of course, but nothing came of it.
It was such a small matter that Mrs. Armitage
wouldn't hear of my calling in the police or
anything of that sort, although I felt pretty
certain that there must be a dishonest
servant about somewhere. A servant might
take a plain brooch, you know, who would
feel afraid of a valuable ring, the loss of
which would be made a greater matter of."</p>

<p>"Well, yes&mdash;perhaps so, in the case of
an inexperienced thief, who also would be
likely to snatch up whatever she took in a
hurry. But I'm doubtful. What made you
connect these two robberies together?"</p>

<p>"Nothing whatever&mdash;for some months.
They seemed quite of a different sort. But
scarcely more than a month ago I met Mrs.
Armitage at Brighton, and we talked, among
other things, of the previous robbery&mdash;that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
of Mrs. Heath's bracelet. I described the
circumstances pretty minutely, and when I
mentioned the match found on the table she
said, 'How strange! Why, <i>my</i> thief left a
match on the dressing-table when he took
my poor little brooch!'"</p>

<p>Hewitt nodded. "Yes," he said. "A
spent match, of course?"</p>

<p>"Yes, of course, a spent match. She
noticed it lying close by the pincushion, but
threw it away without mentioning the circumstance.
Still, it seemed rather curious to me
that a match should be lit and dropped, in
each case, on the dressing-cover an inch from
where the article was taken. I mentioned it
to Lloyd when I got back, and he agreed
that it seemed significant."</p>

<p>"Scarcely," said Hewitt, shaking his head.
"Scarcely, so far, to be called significant,
although worth following up. Everybody
uses matches in the dark, you know."</p>

<p>"Well, at any rate, the coincidence appealed
to me so far that it struck me it might be
worth while to describe the brooch to the
police in order that they could trace it if it
had been pawned. They had tried that, of
course, over the bracelet, without any result,
but I fancied the shot might be worth
making, and might possibly lead us on the
track of the more serious robbery."</p>

<p>"Quite so. It was the right thing to do.
Well?"</p>

<p>"Well, they found it. A woman had pawned
it in London&mdash;at a shop in Chelsea. But that
was some time before, and the pawnbroker had
clean forgotten all about the woman's appearance.
The name and address she gave were
false. So that was the end of that business."</p>

<p>"Had any of your servants left you between
the time the brooch was lost and the date of
the pawnticket?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Were all your servants at home on the
day the brooch was pawned?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. I made that inquiry myself."</p>

<p>"Very good. What next?"</p>

<p>"Yesterday&mdash;and this is what made me
send for you. My late wife's sister came
here last Tuesday, and we gave her the room
from which Mrs. Heath lost her bracelet.
She had with her a very old-fashioned brooch,
containing a miniature of her father, and set,
in front, with three very fine brilliants and a
few smaller stones. Here we are, though, at
the Croft; I'll tell you the rest indoors."</p>

<p>Hewitt laid his hand on the baronet's arm.
"Don't pull up, Sir James," he said. "Drive
a little further. I should like to have a
general idea of the whole case before we go in."</p>

<p>"Very good." Sir James Norris straightened
the horse's head again and went on.
"Late yesterday afternoon, as my sister-in-law
was changing her dress, she left her room
for a moment to speak to my daughter in her
room, almost adjoining. She was gone no
more than three minutes, or five at most, but
on her return the brooch, which had been
left on the table, had gone. Now, the window
was shut fast, and had not been tampered
with. Of course, the door was open, but so
was my daughter's, and anybody walking
near must have been heard. But the
strangest circumstance, and one that almost
makes me wonder whether I have been
awake to-day or not, was that there lay
<i>a used match</i> on the very spot, as nearly as
possible, where the brooch had been&mdash;and it
was broad daylight!"</p>

<p>Hewitt rubbed his nose and looked
thoughtfully before him. "Um&mdash;curious,
certainly," he said. "Anything else?"</p>

<p>"Nothing more than you shall see for
yourself. I have had the room locked and
watched till you could examine it. My
sister-in-law had heard of your name, and
suggested that you should be called in; so, of
course, I did exactly as she wanted. That
she should have lost that brooch, of all
things, in my house, is most unfortunate;
you see, there was some small difference
about the thing between my late wife and
her sister when their mother died and left it.
It's almost worse than the Heath's bracelet
business, and altogether I'm not pleased
with things, I can assure you. See what a
position it is for me! Here are three ladies
in the space of one year, robbed one after
another in this mysterious fashion in my
house, and I can't find the thief. It's
horrible! People will be afraid to come
near the place. And I can do nothing!"</p>

<p>"Ah, well&mdash;we'll see. Perhaps we had
better turn back now. By-the-bye, were
you thinking of having any alterations or
additions made to your house?"</p>

<p>"No. What makes you ask?"</p>

<p>"I think you might at least consider the
question of painting and decorating, Sir
James&mdash;or, say, putting up another coach-house,
or something, because I should like
to be (to the servants) the architect&mdash;or the
builder, if you please&mdash;come to look round.
You haven't told any of them about this
business?"</p>

<p>"Not a word. Nobody knows but my
relatives and Lloyd. I took every precaution
myself, at once. As to your little disguise,
be the architect, by all means, and do as you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
please. If you can only find this thief and
put an end to this horrible state of affairs,
you'll do me the greatest service I've ever
asked for&mdash;and as to your fee, I'll gladly
make it whatever is usual, and three hundred
in addition."</p>

<p>Martin Hewitt bowed. "You're very
generous, Sir James, and you may be sure
I'll do what I can. As a professional man,
of course, a good fee always stimulates my
interest, although this case of yours certainly
seems interesting enough by itself."</p>

<p>"Most extraordinary! Don't you think
so? Here are three persons, all ladies,
all in my house, two even in the
same room, each successively robbed of
a piece of jewellery, each from a dressing-table,
and a used match left behind in every
case. All in the most difficult&mdash;one would
say impossible&mdash;circumstances for a thief,
and yet there is no clue!"</p>

<p>"Well, we won't say that just yet, Sir James;
we must see. And we must guard against any
undue predisposition to consider the robberies
in a lump. Here we are at the lodge gate
again. Is that your gardener&mdash;the
man who left the ladder
by the lawn on the first occasion
you spoke of?" Mr. Hewitt
nodded in the direction of a
man who was clipping a box
border.</p>

<p>"Yes; will you ask him anything?"</p>

<p>"No, no: at any rate, not
now. Remember the building
alterations. I think, if there is
no objection, I will look first
at the room that the lady&mdash;Mrs.&mdash;&mdash;?"
Hewitt looked
up inquiringly.</p>

<p>"My sister-in-law? Mrs.
Cazenove. Oh, yes, you shall
come to her room at once."</p>

<p>"Thank you. And I think
Mrs. Cazenove had better be
there."</p>

<p>They alighted: and a boy
from the lodge led the horse
and dog-cart away.</p>

<p>Mrs. Cazenove was a thin
and faded, but quick and energetic,
lady of middle age. She
bent her head very slightly on
learning Martin Hewitt's name,
and said: "I must thank you,
Mr. Hewitt, for your very
prompt attention. I need
scarcely say that any help you
can afford in tracing the thief who has my
property&mdash;whoever it may be&mdash;will make me
most grateful. My room is quite ready for
you to examine."</p>

<p>The room was on the second floor&mdash;the
top floor at that part of the building. Some
slight confusion of small articles of dress was
observable in parts of the room.</p>

<p>"This, I take it," inquired Hewitt, "is
exactly as it was at the time the brooch was
missed?"</p>

<p>"Precisely," Mrs. Cazenove answered.
"I have used another room, and put myself
to some other inconveniences, to avoid any
disturbance."</p>

<p>Hewitt stood before the dressing-table.
"Then this is the used match," he observed,
"exactly where it was found?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Where was the brooch?"</p>

<p>"I should say almost on the very same
spot. Certainly no more than a very few
inches away."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 465px;">
<img src="images/i_314.jpg" width="465" height="619" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"HEWITT STOOD BEFORE THE DRESSING TABLE."</p></div>
</div>

<p>Hewitt examined the match closely. "It
is burnt very little," he remarked. "It would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
appear to have gone out at once. Could
you hear it struck?"</p>

<p>"I heard nothing whatever; absolutely
nothing."</p>

<p>"If you will step into Miss Norris's room
now for a moment," Hewitt suggested, "we
will try an experiment. Tell me if you hear
matches struck, and how many. Where is
the match-stand?"</p>

<p>The match-stand proved to be empty, but
matches were found in Miss Norris's room,
and the test was made. Each striking could
be heard distinctly, even with one of the
doors pushed to.</p>

<p>"Both your own door and Miss Norris's
were open, I understand; the window shut
and fastened inside as it is now, and nothing
but the brooch was disturbed?"</p>

<p>"Yes, that was so."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Mrs. Cazenove. I don't
think I need trouble you any further just at
present. I think, Sir James," Hewitt added,
turning to the baronet, who was standing by
the door&mdash;"I think we will see the other
room and take a walk outside the house, if
you please. I suppose, by-the-bye, that there
is no getting at the matches left behind on
the first and second occasions?"</p>

<p>"No," Sir James answered. "Certainly
not here. The Scotland Yard man may have
kept his."</p>

<p>The room that Mrs. Armitage had occupied
presented no peculiar feature. A few feet
below the window the roof of the billiard-room
was visible, consisting largely of skylight.
Hewitt glanced casually about the
walls, ascertained that the furniture and
hangings had not been materially changed
since the second robbery, and expressed his
desire to see the windows from the outside.
Before leaving the room, however, he wished
to know the names of any persons who were
known to have been about the house on the
occasions of all three robberies.</p>

<p>"Just carry your mind back, Sir James,"
he said. "Begin with yourself, for instance.
Where were you at these times?"</p>

<p>"When Mrs. Heath lost her bracelet I
was in Tagley Wood all the afternoon. When
Mrs. Armitage was robbed, I believe I was
somewhere about the place most of the time
she was out. Yesterday I was down at the
farm." Sir James's face broadened. "I
don't know whether you call those suspicious
movements?" he added, and laughed.</p>

<p>"Not at all; I only asked you so that,
remembering your own movements, you
might the better recall those of the rest of
the household. Was anybody, to your knowledge&mdash;<i>anybody</i>,
mind&mdash;in the house on all
three occasions?"</p>

<p>"Well, you know, it's quite impossible to
answer for all the servants. You'll only get
that by direct questioning&mdash;I can't possibly
remember things of that sort. As to the
family and visitors&mdash;why, you don't suspect
any of them, do you?"</p>

<p>"I don't suspect a soul, Sir James," Hewitt
answered, beaming genially, "not a soul.
You see, I <i>can't</i> suspect people till I know
something about where they were. It's quite
possible there will be independent evidence
enough as it is, but you must help me if you
can. The visitors, now. Was there any
visitor here each time&mdash;or even on the first
and last occasions only?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;not one. And my own sister, perhaps
you will be pleased to know, was only
there at the time of the first robbery."</p>

<p>"Just so. And your daughter, as I have
gathered, was clearly absent from the spot
each time&mdash;indeed, was in company with the
party robbed. Your niece, now?"</p>

<p>"Why, hang it all, Mr. Hewitt, I can't talk
of my niece as a suspected criminal. The
poor girl's under my protection, and I really
can't allow&mdash;"</p>

<p>Hewitt raised his hand and shook his head
deprecatingly.</p>

<p>"My dear sir, haven't I said that I don't
suspect a soul? <i>Do</i> let me know how the
people were distributed, as nearly as possible.
Let me see. It was your niece, I think, who
found that Mrs. Armitage's door was locked&mdash;this
door in fact&mdash;on the day she lost her
brooch?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it was."</p>

<p>"Just so&mdash;at the time when Mrs. Armitage,
herself, had forgotten whether she locked it
or not. And yesterday&mdash;was she out
then?"</p>

<p>"No, I think not. Indeed, she goes out
very little&mdash;her health is usually bad. She
was indoors, too, at the time of the Heath
robbery, since you ask. But come, now, I
don't like this. It's ridiculous to suppose
that <i>she</i> knows anything of it."</p>

<p>"I don't suppose it, as I have said. I am
only asking for information. That is all your
resident family, I take it, and you know
nothing of anybody else's movements&mdash;except,
perhaps, Mr. Lloyd's?"</p>

<p>"Lloyd? Well, you know yourself that
he was out with the ladies when the first
robbery took place. As to the others, I don't
remember. Yesterday he was probably in
his room, writing. I think that acquits <i>him</i>,
eh?" Sir James looked quizzically into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
broad face of the affable detective, who smiled
and replied:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, of course, nobody can be in two
places at once, else what would become of
the <i>alibi</i> as an institution? But as I have
said, I am only setting my facts in order.
Now, you see, we get down to the servants&mdash;unless
some stranger is the party wanted.
Shall we go outside now?"</p>

<p>Lenton Croft was a large, desultory sort of
house, nowhere more than three floors high,
and mostly only two. It had been added to
bit by bit till it zig-zagged about its site, as
Sir James Norris expressed it, "like a game
of dominoes." Hewitt scrutinized its external
features carefully as they strolled round, and
stopped some little while before the windows
of the two bedrooms he had just seen from
the inside. Presently they approached the
stables and coach-house, where a groom was
washing the wheels of the dog-cart.</p>

<p>"Do you mind my smoking?" Hewitt
asked Sir James. "Perhaps you will take
a cigar yourself&mdash;they are not so bad, I
think. I will ask your man for a light."</p>

<p>Sir James felt for his
own match-box, but Hewitt
had gone, and was lighting
his cigar with a match from
a box handed him by the
groom. A smart little
terrier was trotting about
by the coach-house, and
Hewitt stooped to rub its
head. Then he made
some observation about the
dog, which enlisted the
groom's interest, and was
soon absorbed in a chat
with the man. Sir James,
waiting a little way off,
tapped the stones rather
impatiently with his foot,
and presently moved
away.</p>

<p>For full a quarter of an
hour Hewitt chatted with
the groom, and when at
last he came away and
overtook Sir James, that
gentleman was about re-entering
the house.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, Sir
James," Hewitt said, "for
leaving you in that unceremonious
fashion to talk to
your groom, but a dog, Sir
James&mdash;a good dog&mdash;will
draw me anywhere."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 498px;">
<img src="images/i_315.jpg" width="498" height="622" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"HEWITT CHATTED WITH THE GROOM."</p></div>
</div>

<p>"Oh," replied Sir James, shortly.</p>

<p>"There is one other thing," Hewitt went
on, disregarding the other's curtness, "that I
should like to know: There are two windows
directly below that of the room occupied
yesterday by Mrs. Cazenove&mdash;one on each
floor. What rooms do they light?"</p>

<p>"That on the ground floor is the morning-room;
the other is Mr. Lloyd's&mdash;my secretary.
A sort of study or sitting-room."</p>

<p>"Now, you will see at once, Sir James,"
Hewitt pursued, with an affable determination
to win the baronet back to good
humour, "you will see at once that if a
ladder had been used in Mrs. Heath's case,
anybody looking from either of these rooms
would have seen it."</p>

<p>"Of course. The Scotland Yard man
questioned everybody as to that, but nobody
seemed to have been in either of the rooms
when the thing occurred; at any rate, nobody
saw anything."</p>

<p>"Still, I think I should like to look
out of those windows myself; it will, at
least, give me an idea of what <i>was</i> in view<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
and what was not, if anybody had been
there."</p>

<p>Sir James Norris led the way to the morning-room.
As they reached the door, a
young lady, carrying a book and walking very
languidly, came out. Hewitt stepped aside
to let her pass, and afterwards said, interrogatively:
"Miss Norris&mdash;your daughter, Sir
John?"</p>

<p>"No, my niece. Do you want to ask her
anything? Dora, my dear," Sir James added,
following her in the corridor, "this is Mr.
Hewitt, who is investigating these wretched
robberies for me. I think he would like to
hear if you remember anything happening at
any of the three times."</p>

<p>The lady bowed slightly, and said in a
plaintive drawl: "I, uncle? Really, I don't
remember anything; nothing at all."</p>

<p>"You found Mrs. Armitage's door locked,
I believe," asked Hewitt, "when you tried
it, on the afternoon when she lost her
brooch?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; I believe it was locked. Yes,
it was."</p>

<p>"Had the key been left in?"</p>

<p>"The key? Oh, no! I think not; no."</p>

<p>"Do you remember anything out of the
common happening&mdash;anything whatever, no
matter how trivial&mdash;on the day Mrs. Heath
lost her bracelet?"</p>

<p>"No, really I don't. I can't remember at
all."</p>

<p>"Nor yesterday?"</p>

<p>"No, nothing. I don't remember anything."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Hewitt, hastily;
"thank you. Now the morning-room, Sir
James."</p>

<p>In the morning-room Hewitt stayed but a
few seconds, doing little more than casually
glance out of the windows. In the room
above he took a little longer time. It was a
comfortable room, but with rather effeminate
indications about its contents. Little pieces
of draped silk-work hung about the furniture,
and Japanese silk fans decorated the mantelpiece.
Near the window was a cage containing
a grey parrot, and the writing-table was
decorated with two vases of flowers.</p>

<p>"Lloyd makes himself pretty comfortable,
eh?" Sir James observed. "But it isn't
likely anybody would be here while he was
out, at the time that bracelet went."</p>

<p>"No," replied Hewitt, meditatively. "No,
I suppose not."</p>

<p>He stared thoughtfully out of the window,
and then, still deep in thought, rattled at the
wires of the cage with a quill tooth-pick and
played a moment with the parrot. Then
looking up at the window again, he said:
"That is Mr. Lloyd, isn't it, coming back in
a fly?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I think so. Is there anything else
you would care to see here?"</p>

<p>"No, thank you," Hewitt replied; "I don't
think there is."</p>

<p>They went down to the smoking-room,
and Sir James went away to speak to his
secretary. When he returned, Hewitt
said, quietly, "I think, Sir James&mdash;I <i>think</i>
that I shall be able to give you your thief
presently."</p>

<p>"What! Have you a clue? Who do you
think? I began to believe you were hopelessly
stumped."</p>

<p>"Well, yes. I have rather a good clue,
although I can't tell you much about it just
yet. But it is so good a clue that I should
like to know now whether you are determined
to prosecute, when you have the criminal?"</p>

<p>"Why, bless me, of course," Sir James
replied, with surprise. "It doesn't rest with
me, you know&mdash;the property belongs to my
friends. And even if <i>they</i> were disposed to
let the thing slide, I shouldn't allow it&mdash;I
couldn't, after they had been robbed in my
house."</p>

<p>"Of course, of course. Then, if I can, I
should like to send a message to Twyford
by somebody perfectly trustworthy&mdash;not a
servant. Could anybody go?"</p>

<p>"Well, there's Lloyd, although he's only
just back from his journey. But if it's important,
he'll go."</p>

<p>"It is important. The fact is, we must
have a policeman or two here this evening,
and I'd like Mr. Lloyd to fetch them without
telling anybody else."</p>

<p>Sir James rang, and, in response to his
message, Mr. Lloyd appeared. While Sir
James gave his secretary his instructions,
Hewitt strolled to the door of the smoking-room,
and intercepted the latter as he came
out.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry to give you this trouble, Mr.
Lloyd," he said, "but I must stay here
myself for a little, and somebody who can be
trusted must go. Will you just bring back a
police-constable with you?&mdash;or rather two&mdash;two
would be better. That is all that is
wanted. You won't let the servants know,
will you? Of course, there will be a female
searcher at the Twyford police-station? Ah&mdash;of
course. Well, you needn't bring her, you
know. That sort of thing is done at the
station." And chatting thus confidentially,
Martin Hewitt saw him off.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span></p>

<div class="caption"><p>"I AM SORRY TO GIVE YOU THE TROUBLE, MR. LLOYD."</p></div>
</div>

<p>When Hewitt returned to the smoking-room
Sir James said, suddenly, "Why, bless
my soul, Mr. Hewitt, we haven't fed you!
I'm awfully sorry. We came in rather late
for lunch, you know, and this business has
bothered me so, I clean forgot everything
else. There's no dinner till seven, so you'd
better let me give you something now. I'm
really sorry. Come along."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Sir James," Hewitt replied;
"I won't take much. A few biscuits,
perhaps, or something of that sort. And,
by-the-bye, if you don't mind, I rather think
I should like to take it alone. The fact is,
I want to go over this case thoroughly by
myself. Can you put me in a room?"</p>

<p>"Any room you like. Where will you go?
The dining-room's rather large, but there's
my study, that's pretty snug, or&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Perhaps I can go into Mr. Lloyd's room
for half an hour or so&mdash;I don't
think he'll mind, and it's pretty
comfortable."</p>

<p>"Certainly, if you'd like. I'll
tell them to send you whatever
they've got."</p>

<p>"Thank you very much. Perhaps
they'll also send me a lump of sugar
and a walnut&mdash;it's&mdash;it's just a little
fad of mine."</p>

<p>"A&mdash;what? A lump of sugar
and a walnut?" Sir James stopped
for a moment, with his hand on the
bell-rope. "Oh, certainly, if you'd
like it; certainly," he added, and
stared after this detective of curious
tastes as he left the room.</p>

<p>When the vehicle, bringing back
the secretary and the policemen,
drew up on the drive, Martin
Hewitt left the room on the first
floor and proceeded downstairs. On
the landing he met Sir James Norris
and Mrs. Cazenove, who stared with
astonishment on perceiving that the
detective carried in his hand the
parrot-cage.</p>

<p>"I think our business is about
brought to a head now," Hewitt
remarked, on the stairs. "Here are
the police-officers from Twyford."
The men were standing in the hall
with Mr. Lloyd, who, on catching
sight of the cage in Hewitt's hand,
paled suddenly.</p>

<p>"This is the person who will be
charged, I think," Hewitt pursued,
addressing the officers, and indicating
Lloyd with his finger.</p>

<p>"What, Lloyd?" gasped Sir James, aghast.
"No&mdash;not Lloyd&mdash;nonsense!"</p>

<p>"He doesn't seem to think it nonsense
himself, does he?" Hewitt placidly observed.
Lloyd had sunk on a chair, and, grey of face,
was staring blindly at the man he had run
against at the office door that morning. His
lips moved in spasms, but there was no sound.
The wilted flower fell from his button-hole to
the floor, but he did not move.</p>

<p>"This is his accomplice," Hewitt went on,
placing the parrot and cage on the hall table,
"though I doubt whether there will be any
use in charging <i>him</i>. Eh, Polly?"</p>

<p>The parrot put its head aside and chuckled.
"Hullo, Polly!" it quietly gurgled. "Come
along!"</p>

<p>Sir James Norris was hopelessly bewildered.
"Lloyd&mdash;Lloyd&mdash;" he said, under his breath,
"Lloyd&mdash;and that!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span></p>

<img src="images/i_319.jpg" width="432" height="629" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"SIR JAMES NORRIS WAS HOPELESSLY BEWILDERED."</p></div>
</div>

<p>"This was his little messenger, his useful
Mercury," Hewitt explained, tapping the cage
complacently; "in fact, the actual lifter.
Hold him up."</p>

<p>The last remark referred to the wretched
Lloyd, who had fallen forward with something
between a sob and a loud sigh. The
policemen took him by the arms and propped
him in his chair.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"System?" said Hewitt, with a shrug of
the shoulders an hour or two after, in Sir
James's study. "I can't say I have a system.
I call it nothing but common-sense and a
sharp pair of eyes. Nobody using these
could help taking the right road in this
case. I began at the match, just as the
Scotland Yard man did, but I had the
advantage of taking a line through three
cases. To begin with, it was plain that that
match, being left there in daylight, in Mrs.
Cazenove's room, could not have been used
to light the table-top, in the full glare of the
window; therefore it had been used for some
other purpose&mdash;<i>what</i> purpose I could not,
at the moment, guess. Habitual
thieves, you know, often have
curious superstitions, and some
will never take anything without
leaving something behind&mdash;a
pebble or a piece of coal, or
something like that&mdash;in the
premises they have been robbing.
It seemed at first extremely likely
that this was a case of that kind.
The match had clearly been
<i>brought in</i>&mdash;because when I
asked for matches there were
none in the stand&mdash;not even an
empty box; and the room had
not been disturbed. Also the
match probably had not been
struck there, nothing having been
heard, although, of course, a
mistake in this matter was just
possible. This match then, it was
fair to assume, had been lit somewhere
else and blown out immediately&mdash;I
remarked at the time that
it was very little burnt. Plainly it
could not have been treated thus
for nothing, and the only possible
object would have been to prevent
it igniting accidentally. Following
on this it became obvious that
the match was used, for whatever
purpose, not <i>as</i> a match, but
merely as a convenient splinter of
wood.</p>

<p>"So far so good. But on examining the
match very closely I observed&mdash;as you can
see for yourself&mdash;certain rather sharp indentations
in the wood. They are very small,
you see, and scarcely visible, except upon
narrow inspection; but there they are, and
their positions are regular. See&mdash;there are
two on each side, each opposite the corresponding
mark of the other pair. The match,
in fact, would seem to have been gripped in
some fairly sharp instrument, holding it at
two points above, and two below&mdash;an instrument,
as it may at once strike you, not unlike
the beak of a bird.</p>

<p>"Now, here was an idea. What living creature
but a bird could possibly have entered
Mrs. Heath's window without a ladder&mdash;supposing
no ladder to have been used&mdash;or could
have got into Mrs. Armitage's window without
lifting the sash higher than the eight or
ten inches it was already open? Plainly,
nothing. Further, it is significant that only
<i>one</i> article was stolen at a time, although
others were about. A human being could
have carried any reasonable number, but a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
bird could only take one at a time. But
why should a bird carry a match in its
beak? Certainly it must have been trained
to do that for a purpose, and a little
consideration made that purpose pretty
clear. A noisy, chattering bird would probably
betray itself at once. Therefore it
must be trained to keep quiet both while
going for and coming away with its plunder.
What readier or more probably effectual way
than, while teaching it to carry without
dropping, to teach it also to keep quiet while
carrying? The one thing would practically
cover the other.</p>

<p>"I thought at once, of course, of a jackdaw
or a magpie&mdash;these birds' thievish reputations
made the guess natural. But the marks on
the match were much too wide apart to have
been made by the beak of either. I conjectured,
therefore, that it must be a raven.
So that when we arrived near the coach-house
I seized the opportunity of a little chat with
your groom on the subject of dogs and pets
in general, and ascertained that there was no
tame raven in the place. I also, incidentally,
by getting a light from the coach-house box
of matches, ascertained that the match found
was of the sort generally used about the
establishment&mdash;the large, thick, red-topped
English match. But I further found that
Mr. Lloyd had a parrot which was a most
intelligent pet, and had been trained into
comparative quietness&mdash;for a parrot. Also, I
learnt that more than once the groom had
met Mr. Lloyd carrying his parrot under his
coat&mdash;it having, as its owner explained, learnt
the trick of opening its cage-door, and
escaping.</p>

<p>"I said nothing, of course, to you of all
this, because I had as yet nothing but a
train of argument and no results. I got to
Lloyd's room as soon as possible. My chief
object in going there was achieved when I
played with the parrot, and induced it to bite
a quill tooth-pick.</p>

<p>"When you left me in the smoking-room
I compared the quill and the match very
carefully, and found that the marks corresponded
exactly. After this I felt very little
doubt indeed. The fact of Lloyd having
met the ladies walking before dark on the
day of the first robbery proved nothing,
because, since it was clear that the match
had <i>not</i> been used to procure a light, the
robbery might as easily have taken place in
daylight as not&mdash;must have so taken place,
in fact, if my conjectures were right. That
they were right I felt no doubt. There
could be no other explanation.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 639px;">
<img src="images/i_320.jpg" width="639" height="464" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"EXPLAINING."</p></div>
</div>

<p>"When Mrs. Heath left her window open
and her door shut, anybody climbing upon the
open sash of Lloyd's high window could have
put the bird upon the sill above. The match
placed in the bird's beak for the purpose I have
indicated and struck first, in case by accident
it should ignite by rubbing against something
and startle the bird&mdash;this match would, of
course, be dropped just where the object to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
be removed was taken up; as you know, in
every case the match was found almost upon
the spot where the missing article had been
left&mdash;scarcely a likely triple coincidence, had
the match been used by a human thief. This
would have been done as soon after the ladies
had left as possible, and there would then have
been plenty of time for Lloyd to hurry out
and meet them before dark&mdash;especially plenty
of time to meet them <i>coming back</i>, as they
must have been, since they were carrying
their ferns. The match was an article well
chosen for its purpose, as being a not
altogether unlikely thing to find on a
dressing-table, and, if noticed, likely to lead
to the wrong conclusions adopted by the
official detective.</p>

<p>"In Mrs. Armitage's case, the taking of an
inferior brooch and the leaving of a more
valuable ring pointed clearly either to the
operator being a fool or unable to distinguish
values, and certainly, from other indications,
the thief seemed no fool. The door was locked,
and the gasfitter, so to speak, on guard, and
the window was only eight or ten inches open
and propped with a brush. A human thief
entering the window would have disturbed
this arrangement, and would scarcely risk
discovery by attempting to replace it,
especially a thief in so great a hurry as to
snatch the brooch up without unfastening the
pin. The bird could pass through the opening
as it was, and <i>would have</i> to tear the pincushion
to pull the brooch off&mdash;probably holding the
cushion down with its claw the while.</p>

<p>"Now, in yesterday's case we had an alteration
of conditions. The window was shut
and fastened, but the door was open&mdash;but
only left for a few minutes, during which time
no sound was heard either of coming or
going. Was it not possible, then, that the
thief was <i>already</i> in the room, in hiding,
while Mrs. Cazenove was there, and seized its
first opportunity on her temporary absence?
The room is full of draperies, hangings, and
what-not, allowing of plenty of concealment
for a bird, and a bird could leave the place
noiselessly and quickly. That the whole
scheme was strange mattered not at all.
Robberies presenting such unaccountable
features must have been effected by strange
means of one sort or another. There was no
improbability&mdash;consider how many hundreds
of examples of infinitely higher degrees of
bird-training are exhibited in the London
streets every week for coppers.</p>

<p>"So that, on the whole, I felt pretty sure
of my ground. But before taking any definite
steps, I resolved to see if Polly could
not be persuaded to exhibit his accomplishments
to an indulgent stranger. For that
purpose I contrived to send Lloyd away
again and have a quiet hour alone with his
bird. A piece of sugar, as everybody knows,
is a good parrot bribe; but a walnut, split in
half, is a better&mdash;especially if the bird be
used to it; so I got you to furnish me with
both. Polly was shy at first, but I generally
get along very well with pets, and a little
perseverance soon led to a complete private
performance for my benefit. Polly would
take the match, mute as wax, jump on the
table, pick up the brightest thing he could
see, in a great hurry, leave the match behind,
and scuttle away round the room; but at
first wouldn't give up the plunder to <i>me</i>. It
was enough. I also took the liberty, as you
know, of a general look round, and discovered
that little collection of Brummagem
rings and trinkets that you have just seen&mdash;used
in Polly's education, no doubt. When
we sent Lloyd away it struck me that he
might as well be usefully employed as not,
so I got him to fetch the police&mdash;deluding
him a little, I fear, by talking about
the servants and a female searcher. There
will be no trouble about evidence&mdash;he'll
confess; of that I'm sure. I know the sort
of man. But I doubt if you'll get Mrs.
Cazenove's brooch back. You see, he has
been to London to-day, and by this the
swag is probably broken up."</p>

<p>Sir James listened to Hewitt's explanation
with many expressions of assent and some of
surprise. When it was over he smoked a
few whiffs and then said: "But Mrs. Armitage's
brooch was pawned; and by a woman."</p>

<p>"Exactly. I expect our friend Lloyd was
rather disgusted at his small luck&mdash;probably
gave the brooch to some female connection
in London, and she realized on it. Such
persons don't always trouble to give a correct
address."</p>

<p>The two smoked in silence for a few
minutes, and then Hewitt continued: "I
don't expect our friend has had an easy job
altogether with that bird. His successes
at most have only been three, and I
suspect he had many failures and not
a few anxious moments that we know
nothing of. I should judge as much
merely from what the groom told me of
frequently meeting Lloyd with his parrot.
But the plan was not a bad one&mdash;not at all.
Even if the bird had been caught in the act,
it would only have been 'That mischievous
parrot!' you see. And his master would only
have been looking for him."</p>

<h2><a name="The_Palace_of" id="The_Palace_of"><span class="smcap">The Palace of
Vanity</span></a></h2></div>
</div>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">From the French of Madame &Eacute;mile
de Girardin.</span></p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_322.png" width="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">It</span> was a magnificent palace,
built on the side of a broad
highway, along which a great
number of travellers passed
every day.</p>

<p>This palace had an elegant
fa&ccedil;ade on each of its four sides; a colonnade
supported by admirable columns surrounded
it. It is true that this colonnade prevented
the entrance of any light into the palace; but
the exterior view of it was so beautiful that
nobody ventured to criticise it objectively;
besides, what need of daylight has anybody
in a palace? Have they not lustres and
candelabra? Why trouble themselves about
the sun, then? Every portion of the dome
of this palace was gilded, and produced a
most dazzling effect.</p>

<p>The queen who lived in this dwelling-place
was a tall and handsome woman, who, instead
of a heart, had in her bosom a large diamond
cut in the form of a heart; it was believed
to be on that account that she had never
loved.</p>

<p>On the front of her palace were written
these words in ruby letters:</p>

<p class="center">"<span class="smcap">Here You May Obtain Whatever You
May Wish For.</span>"
</p>

<p>A young man passing along the road
stopped to look at this superb monument,
and having perceived this sign&mdash;for it bore a
strong resemblance to a sign&mdash;he suddenly
exclaimed:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Faith, I'd like to go inside! I'm tired of
being in the condition I'm in, and should
not be sorry to be something else."</p>

<p>As he went towards one of the porticos,
he noticed a beggar seated near it on a stone
and laughing.</p>

<p>"You are laughing at me, old fellow," said
the young wayfarer; "but I give you back
your laugh; for you must be a fool to remain
in rags at the door of a palace where
you have only to wish for a new coat to be
dressed like a prince. Perhaps you don't
know how to read?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes!&mdash;I know how to read&mdash;even
writing in rubies," replied the old man.</p>

<p>"Well, then, have you nothing to desire,
that you do not enter this palace?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span></p>

<p>"Truly, yes. I desire more things than
one; but not any such as they give away
here."</p>

<p>The old man had such an air of cunning
as he said this, that the young man mistrusted
him.</p>

<p>"He is laying some kind of trap for me,"
he thought, and was about passing on his
way.</p>

<p>"Don't be afraid; no harm will come to
you in this palace," the old man went on.
"Troubles exist there only for those who
ask for them: take my word for it, you may
go in fearlessly."</p>

<p>"Yes; but may I come out again?"</p>

<p>"Certainly you may," replied the beggar,
"if you find nothing there you wish for."</p>

<p>The young man hesitated. He saw a
number of people pass along the road,
and not one of them seemed to have
an idea of entering this palace. That
struck him as being suspicious, and he took
alarm.</p>

<p>"Is this palace shunned by travellers?
How comes it that not one enters it?"</p>

<p>"It is because they have heard about it;
they know that people are bored there, and,
in his home, everybody likes to amuse himself."
Seeing that the young man was curious
to visit this monument, the old beggar
said to him: "I'll tell you what I'll
do; if you'll give me the price of a
bottle of good wine, I'll sacrifice
myself and go in with you&mdash;and
we'll laugh together at the imbeciles
who live there."</p>

<p>"Agreed!" cried the young man.</p>

<p>He gave the old beggar a piece of
money, and they went up to the door.
It was made of crystal, and afforded a
view of the interior and of the bell
which had to be rung to obtain
admission.</p>

<p>On examining it carefully, the young
traveller observed that this bell was
made of gold, and had for its clapper
a fine pear-shaped pearl, of such beauty
that it dazzled his sight.</p>

<p>He stood motionless, gazing at it.</p>

<p>"Ring!" cried the old beggar, becoming
impatient at length.</p>

<p>"Really, I dare not," replied the
young man; "I am afraid of injuring
this beautiful pearl by ringing the bell.
It would be such a pity; it is so
admirable!"</p>

<p>"Bah!" cried the beggar, who knew
very little about jewels, "let me do
it&mdash;I'm not afraid."</p>

<p>"No, no; let us rather knock at the
door&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But he stopped himself; for it occurred to
him that, as this handsome door was made of
crystal, a blow with the knocker would at
least crack it.</p>

<p>Tired by these hesitations, the old beggar
seized the knocker and struck so heavy a
blow with it that the door was shivered into
fragments.</p>

<p>They entered freely.</p>

<p>There was nobody in the vestibule; in
the Palace of Vanity nobody would remain
in the ante-chamber. And yet this ante-chamber
surpassed in luxury many drawing
rooms. It was adorned with statues representing
gods and goddesses, and pictures
representing kings and queens, princes and
princesses.</p>

<p>It was paved with jasper and porphyry;
but this pavement was so highly polished, so
slippery, that the young man, whose shoes
were studded with hobnails, was near falling
several times within the space of three
minutes. He was obliged to cling to the
walls, and would rather have walked upon
ice, as then he might have had on a pair of
skates.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 453px;">
<img src="images/i_323.jpg" width="453" height="583" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"THE DOOR WAS SHIVERED INTO FRAGMENTS."</p></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span></p>

<p>The old man also slipped a little, but his
beggar's staff supported him.</p>

<p>After much difficulty they at length reached
a vast room, in which a number of persons
were assembled. Their costumes were
magnificent; the women were covered with
jewellery. They had jewels even on their rich
Court mantles, which trailed along the carpet;
their bracelets, their necklaces, their diadems
were dazzling. The young traveller, whom
we shall henceforth call Alm&eacute;ric, was delighted
by the sight.</p>

<p>The men were not much less splendidly
decorated than the women in this drawing-room:
they wore coats of velvet embroidered
with diamonds, and on their heads caps, each
ornamented with four ostrich feathers worthy
to adorn the hat of a queen.</p>

<p>"Who are these great personages?" Alm&eacute;ric
asked the beggar.</p>

<p>"These are the domestics of the house,"
he replied.</p>

<p>Indeed, as soon as these <i>princes</i> saw the
two travellers enter, they came to them to
take their orders, and to ask whether they
desired to visit the palace.</p>

<p>"Phew!" said Alm&eacute;ric to himself, "here
are indeed some well-kept people!" But fear of
being indiscreet made him say aloud: "Perhaps
we should be incommoding the inhabitants
of this palace, by visiting them at this
hour; perhaps&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Incommode the inhabitants of the Palace
of Vanity!" cried the beggar, ironically; "I
defy you to do it, young man!&mdash;they are here
only to show themselves, and they are never
troubled by people coming to admire them:
you might as well be afraid of incommoding
actors by going to the theatre to see them."</p>

<p>The young man could not refrain from
laughing at this reflection.</p>

<p>"Show us the wonders of the palace," the
old man said to the attendants. "Here is a
traveller who desires to live here; but, before
expressing his wishes, he wants to know something
about you. Go before and conduct
us."</p>

<p>The young traveller was greatly surprised
at the old beggar's off-hand treatment of these
superb valets, and at their readiness to obey
him; he did not know that the philosopher's
vanity takes the <i>pas</i> of all others. So many
things astonished him that he dare not ask
any more questions.</p>

<p>A fat woman of ripe age, who filled the
functions of housekeeper, at once stepped
forward and handed the keys of the house to
the valet who was to conduct the two guests.
Alm&eacute;ric saw behind her two little pages
who were bearing her mantle, and whom the
enormity of her bulk had at first entirely
hidden from his sight.</p>

<p>These two pages no more quitted her than
her shadow. It was a prerogative of her rank
not to be able to take a single step, or perform
a single act, without the attendance of
these two babe-kins.</p>

<p>Her eagerness to obey the beggar made
her forget her two little gendarmes, and she
advanced so quickly, without warning them,
that they did not think of following her, and
held on so firmly to her mantle that, in
hurrying forward, she pulled them both down
upon their noses, while she herself was jerked
upon her back. As she was very heavy, she
hurt herself considerably, and the other
servants hastened to her assistance.</p>

<p>"A Court mantle," said the beggar, "does
not appear to me very commodious for housework."</p>

<p>And the young traveller could not refrain
from laughing at this reflection.</p>

<p>One of the lackeys having taken up a
candelabrum, conducted the strangers through
the vast apartments of the palace. They
reached the dining-room.</p>

<p>"Do you wish to sup, gentlemen?"</p>

<p>"By all means," said the beggar; "there
is nothing but a good meal which is not a
vanity."</p>

<p>He seated himself at table. But he had
hardly tasted any of the dishes set before
him, than he found them so fanciful, so salted,
peppered, sugared, truffled, and mixed, that
he would not partake of one of them;
impossible to recognise the meat of a single
animal, so highly was it seasoned.</p>

<p>"What is this?" asked the old man&mdash;"rabbit?"</p>

<p>"No, monsieur&mdash;they are lamb cutlets."</p>

<p>"And this: lentil soup?"</p>

<p>"No, monsieur; hare soup."</p>

<p>It was a confusion, past all understanding.
And yet more: everything served was cold,
for the hot-water plates were all of malachite,
and nobody dare pour hot water into them.</p>

<p>"Faith," said the beggar, "I'd rather have
an omelette on a pewter platter," and he
handed to a servant in waiting his gilded
plate. The servant in bowing to take it took
no heed of the candles burning on the table,
and forgot all about the plumes which adorned
his head. They approached too near the
flame, and a strong odour of burnt feathers
announced that the plume was grilling.</p>

<p>"A white <i>panach&eacute;</i> does not appear to me
to be convenient for waiting at table," said
the beggar again; and again the young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
stranger could not refrain from laughing at
this reflection.</p>

<p>"The queen of this mansion, the Princess
Vanita, is not here at present, is she?" asked
the beggar.</p>

<p>"No, monsieur," replied one of the
lackeys; "she is, at this moment, with her
favourite adorers, in a country the name of
which I forget, but which is highly renowned
for its wines."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 641px;">
<img src="images/i_325.jpg" width="641" height="561" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"SHE PULLED THEM BOTH DOWN UPON THEIR NOSES."</p></div>
</div>

<p>"Ah! I guess she is in France," said the
beggar: "she will not soon be back."</p>

<p>Perched on a rich rod, a handsome paroquet
was screeching at some distance from
the table: "Fly quickly! fly quickly! Don't
stop in this palace!"</p>

<p>Alm&eacute;ric went over to her.</p>

<p>"Why should we fly?" he asked: "are
you not happy here?"</p>

<p>"Alas!&mdash;look at me," replied the paroquet;
"I wished to be beautiful: I desired claws of
gold, ruby wings; and now I am condemned
to rest here all my life, motionless, as you
see; for it is impossible to fly with wings
made of rubies or to walk with feet made
of gold."</p>

<p>Near the window they observed a large
cat. It did not stir from where it lay, and
appeared to be very discontented.</p>

<p>"What is the matter with you, puss?"
inquired Alm&eacute;ric.</p>

<p>"Excuse me," replied the cat, "is it a
horse, a serpent, a donkey, a man, or a
woman to whom I have the honour of
speaking? I can't see; pray excuse me."</p>

<p>"You are blind?" said Alm&eacute;ric, compassionately.</p>

<p>"Alas! yes, monsieur&mdash;and by my own
fault. I had so long heard emerald eyes
praised that I wished for them, and ever
since that time have lost my sight. I do not
even know whether my eyes are as pretty as
they have been said to be. Will you be so
kind as to tell me what is your impression
on the subject? Look at me. Do you
think that emerald eyes go well with my
face?"</p>

<p>Alm&eacute;ric wished to say that he thought her
eyes beautiful, to console her for having
lost her sight, but the old beggar was
inexorable.</p>

<p>"Your eyes are abominably ugly!" he
said, roughly.</p>

<p>"Impossible!" replied the cat. "They
<i>must</i> shine?"</p>

<p>"No!" cried the old man; "nothing
shines out of its place! Take my advice&mdash;hide
them, put on spectacles; and if ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
you have any more emeralds, make them
into rings and not into eyes."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 418px;">
<img src="images/i_326.jpg" width="418" height="568" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"FLY QUICKLY!"</p></div>
</div>

<p>And, once more, the young man could
not refrain from laughing at this reflection.</p>

<p>On quitting the dining-room, they entered
a superb court paved in mosaic and
surrounded by elegant columns.</p>

<p>They there perceived a bird which, by
its plumage, might have been taken for a
vulture, but whose timid bearing had nothing
of the bird of prey in it.</p>

<p>"There is a vulture that, to me, has a
very stupid look," observed the beggar.
"Who are you, old fellow?" he added,
addressing the vulture.</p>

<p>"I am a vulture, a bird of prey; formerly
a turkey, a farmyard bird. I wished to
mount in rank and quit the sphere in which
I won nothing but disrespect; but I repent&mdash;repent
the change&mdash;for I cannot bring
myself to devour them."</p>

<p>"Devour whom?" cried Alm&eacute;ric.</p>

<p>"Alas! those good turkeys who have
always been so kind to me."</p>

<p>"Ninny!" exclaimed the old beggar, "why
did you get yourself turned into a vulture?
Better to be a turkey and liked,
than a vulture&mdash;and timid."</p>

<p>And again the young man could not
refrain from laughing at this reflection.</p>

<p>In one corner of the court there
was a bear seated on a bench, his
head bowed down upon his chest and
plunged in profound meditation.</p>

<p>"There's a fellow, too, who does not
seem to know much about the business
of a bear," remarked the beggar.
"How did he come to be in this
palace? What vanity has pushed
him into the bear profession? I'd
lay a wager he once had a better."</p>

<p>The beggar approached the melancholy
animal.</p>

<p>"Bear," he asked, "what were you
before you got yourself transformed
into your present shape?"</p>

<p>"I was a doctor's assistant."</p>

<p>"A doctor's assistant!" repeated
Alm&eacute;ric and the beggar in the same
breath.</p>

<p>"Yes, a doctor's assistant," replied
the bear; "but everybody made fun
of my position. Men pursued me
with their irony, made songs about
me, burlesqued me on the stage.
I wished to escape them, and had
myself turned into a bear; but I am
tired of my condition. I was not
born for solitude."</p>

<p>"You old fool!" cried the beggar, angrily,
"why did you leave the calling you were in?
You might have avenged yourself on the men
you detest; for you do not appear to me to be
very learned, and you might have poisoned the
universe with your drugs and your blunders."</p>

<p>The beggar was still speaking, when his
attention was attracted by a gigantic elephant
in an adjoining court.</p>

<p>"An elephant!" he cried. "Who can have
asked to be turned into an elephant? an
ant, I'll wager."</p>

<p>However, the old man was mistaken; it
was not an ant that had desired to be turned
into an elephant: it was a rabbit. He had
only recently obtained that signal favour, and
was still puffed up with pride at his metamorphosis.</p>

<p>He was walking about heavily, and with
an air of importance, and received condescendingly
all the compliments addressed to
him on his new promotion.</p>

<p>The beggar, having learned his history,
advanced towards him familiarly.</p>

<p>"Good-day, bunny!" he said. "Well,
how do you like your big skin?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span></p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 554px;">
<img src="images/i_327.jpg" width="554" height="421" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"'AN ELEPHANT!' HE CRIED."</p></div>
</div>

<p>The elephant was greatly shocked at this
disrespectful tone; but the small practice he
had had in the use of his trunk prevented
him from seeking to avenge himself.</p>

<p>"Thoroughly&mdash;as you see," he replied,
strutting.</p>

<p>"Is it long since you asked this favour?"
inquired the beggar, maliciously.</p>

<p>"No," replied the elephant; "a few days
ago only; as an old rabbit, I had incontestable
claims. I have really only changed in
form: my colour remains the same; my ears,
instead of standing up, now fall down&mdash;that
is the only difference."</p>

<p>"The idiot!" thought the beggar; "he
does not even believe himself to have been
changed!"</p>

<p>"Tell me, my dear fellow," said Alm&eacute;ric,
who was greatly amused by the rabbit's
stupidity, "don't you find your ordinary
habits somewhat deranged?"</p>

<p>"You remind me," replied the rabbit, as
if suddenly struck by an idea: "I am afraid
I <i>shall</i> find my increased bulk inconvenient,
on returning to my burrow this evening."</p>

<p>This time the young man could not possibly
refrain from laughing at that reflection.</p>

<p>"Would you like to see the beautiful
woman, gentlemen?" asked the lackey who
was conducting them.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," replied Alm&eacute;ric, eagerly. "I
should like to see the 'beautiful woman.'
Where is she?"</p>

<p>"This way, gentlemen. Be good enough
to enter this boudoir."</p>

<p>They passed into a charming room, formed
entirely of looking-glasses&mdash;the ceiling, the
wainscotting, all was of looking-glass, in which
one could admire oneself from every point
of view.</p>

<p>The beautiful woman was lying upon a
sofa. On beholding her, the beggar and
Alm&eacute;ric fell back in horror. This beautiful
woman was a monstrosity, but believed herself
to be a <i>chef d'&#339;uvre</i>.</p>

<p>Every part of her was beautiful, and yet
she appeared horrible; because the exaggeration
of beauties makes a hideous ensemble;
because it is harmony which gives grace to
things we admire, movement which gives life;
and this beautiful woman had neither grace
nor movement.</p>

<p>She had been born very pretty, but the
excess of her vanity, and her coquetry, had
made her lose all her advantages. She was
beautiful as Nature had created her; she
wished to be beautiful as beauty is painted:
she exaggerated all her graces and changed
them into deformities.</p>

<p>She asked for silken hair&mdash;she had long
locks of silk, without life or colour; she
desired to have teeth of pearl, and her teeth
appeared horrible: she wished for a wasp-waist,
and her body, drawn in by a tight
belt, was without grace or suppleness,
and looked as if it might snap in two
at any moment; she asked for hands of
alabaster, and her hands became dull and
cold; she desired to have the feet of a child,
and these deformed feet were not strong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
enough to sustain the weight of her body or
to permit her to walk. Nothing more hideous
was ever seen: it was ideal ugliness.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 599px;">
<img src="images/i_328.jpg" width="599" height="585" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN WAS LYING UPON A SOFA."</p></div>
</div>

<p>"Thousand centimes!" exclaimed the
beggar; "how horrible this 'beautiful woman'
is!&mdash;the sight of her makes me in love again
with my old wife!"</p>

<p>Evening being come, a sleeping apartment
was offered the strangers for the night.</p>

<p>"A room here will be better than any I
can get at an inn," thought Alm&eacute;ric, following
the valet, who conducted him to a magnificent
bedroom prepared for travellers.</p>

<p>Exhausted by the fatigues of the day, he
lost no time in undressing and getting into bed.
But he had scarcely stretched himself before
beginning to utter loud cries of distress.</p>

<p>"Horror! my skin is being torn from my
body! I am in torture! What is the meaning
of it? A perfidy! An abominable piece
of cruelty!" and a thousand like complaints:
and yet all he complained of arose from
nothing but the admirable care which had
been taken with his bed.</p>

<p>The sheets which covered it were of the
finest Indian muslin, embroidered with gold
spangles, charming to look upon, but inappreciable
by a person used to lie upon sheets of
coarse Holland. It takes time to get accustomed
to inconveniences of this sort.</p>

<p>Poor Alm&eacute;ric's feet were scratched all
over. Every movement he made in getting
out of this terrible bed tore his skin; his
arms were covered with blood.</p>

<p>"Vanity of vanities!" he cried. "Old
man, beggar, let us fly from this place; there
is no sleeping in this palace, and I am dying
for want of sleep."</p>

<p>"What do you think of sheets embroidered
with gold spangles?" asked the old man,
laughing. "Could you have a more superb
bed to sleep in?"</p>

<p>"Let us get out of this place," cried the
young traveller, who was in no jesting mood;
"I'll not remain here another hour. The men
here are all stupid, the women frightful; one
can neither eat here nor sleep. Let us be off,
old man&mdash;let us be off instantly!"</p>

<p>Alm&eacute;ric, who had hastily redressed himself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
roughly pushed the beggar out of the room,
the old man laughing heartily all the while,
and they quitted the palace together, taking
the way to the beggar's hovel.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 569px;">
<img src="images/i_329.jpg" width="569" height="503" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"I AM IN TORTURE!"</p></div>
</div>

<p>"Sleep here," said the old man, pointing
to his truckle bed; "this mattress is favourable
to sleep, and your rest will not be
disturbed by spangled sheets&mdash;because there
are no sheets of any kind. But what does that
matter?&mdash;it is sleep that makes good
beds, as it is appetite that makes good
meals."</p>

<p>Alm&eacute;ric threw himself on to the beggar's
bed and was soon sound asleep; and the
old man heard him cry out in his dreams:&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is all over! I wished to obtain the
embassy to Constantinople; but I will remain
a simple notary at Saint-Quentin."</p>

<p>And the beggar, in his turn, could not
refrain from laughing at this reflection.</p>

<h2><a name="The_Queer_Side_of_Things" id="The_Queer_Side_of_Things"><i>The Queer Side of Things.</i></a></h2>


<h3>THE MASTER OF GRANGE.</h3>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_330.jpg" width="357" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">There</span> was a rushing,
whirling agitation
in the air&mdash;the
dust rose from
every ledge
and revolved
wildly as a
something passed down the intricacies of
the old back staircase&mdash;passed too rapidly
for recognition. It was the page, pale and
breathless, hurling himself from the top floor
toward the servants' hall.</p>

<p>"There's that ghost agen!" he gasped.
"It's up there a-furridgin among the lumber
in the loft! It <i>is</i>&mdash;I 'eard it myself, I tell
yer! Yer may say 'pooh' if yer like. Yer'd
better go an' see!"</p>

<p>The housekeeper, being the bravest of
those who heard, went up to see. There
certainly were unusual sounds in the vast and
lonely lofts under the roof. Cautiously she
peeped in; and there was the Squire with a
candle ferreting about among the dusty
heaps of lumber.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Wriggs," said the Squire, "there
are a great many useless things here which
we shall never want. I've been thinking that
we might as well&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; no doubt there are many poor
people who could turn them to some use,"
said Mrs. Wriggs. "And we might do worse
than give them&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>Give</i> them!" said the Squire. "Doesn't
it seem rather like bad taste to give away
things which Providence has presented to us?
Wouldn't it be taken as a sort of slight? I
was thinking that we might <i>sell</i> them, now&mdash;for
the good of the House, of course."
The Squire represented the house: he did
a great many things for the good of it&mdash;the
temporal good, of course.</p>

<p>"Eh? Who would buy?" said the Squire.
"If a thing is good enough to accept, Mrs.
Wriggs, it has some value; what has a value
is worth buying. Let us collect all the
articles we have no further use for, and
obtain the highest price for them, by way of
showing to that Providence which has
bestowed them upon us that they have
a value in our eyes. I will accompany you
downstairs, and see what broken saucepans
and other utensils there may be there.
Every little helps, in a good cause."</p>

<p>So the articles were looked out&mdash;saucepans
with holes in them, handles of flat-irons,
chairs without legs, old packing-cases, book
covers, old advertisement sheets of old newspapers,
and so forth; and a "rummage sale"
was held at the Big House. The whole
village attended, and, as a compliment to
the Squire, bought up the articles in lots, at
a few pence per lot. The Squire had never
held aloof from his dependents; it being a
belief that we should, to a certain extent,
share our good things with our poorer
brethren.</p>

<p>But next day the Squire was rummaging
and ferreting harder than ever; all over the
house, from the lofts to the cellars; peering
in every corner, opening every drawer, feeling
in all his pockets; looking behind things, on
top of things, under things, in old hat-boxes,
and glove-boxes, and collar-boxes.</p>

<p>To help at this game gave the greatest
delight to his little son and heir, Master
Rupert, a curly-haired, brown-eyed little
person of seven years. To all offers of
assistance, the Squire replied that it was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
a matter of importance: he had merely
mislaid his handkerchief. Such a search for
a handkerchief has never been made before
or since.</p>

<p>That evening the Squire ate no dinner,
but sat in his study with his head clasped
between his hands, and his elbows on the
table; and so he sat half through the night.
Next morning he was up before dawn; and
in the first grey light a thrush noticed him
peering all over the paths leading from the
house, travelling slowly over them step by
step, and examining every inch. All that
day he spent in pursuing this occupation
(but putting on a lounging and purposeless air
when observed) and in making calls at the
houses of the villagers; and when he returned
to the house, long after dinner-time, he was
so changed and so haggard as to be difficult
to recognise. Creeping to the night nursery,
where little Rupert was asleep in his cot, the
Squire tenderly took him out, bed-clothes
and all, and carried him away to his study,
where he placed him on the sofa, and sat
close by, never removing his eyes from the
child.</p>

<p>Every now and again he would stretch out
his hand and touch the child, and appear
reassured on finding it warm; or he would
place his ear close to its mouth, and give a
sigh of relief on hearing its breathing.</p>

<p>At every creak of the furniture and sough
of the wind the Squire would start; and
once he rose suddenly and hastily locked
the door. Early in the morning the nurse,
waking and missing the child, knocked at
his door to ask whether he had taken it.
And he would not open the door; but stood
before little Rupert, covering him as though
from some enemy, and replying that he was
to remain with him.</p>

<p>About seven he rang, and handed a
telegram form to a servant, with instructions
to send off the message the moment the
wire was available; and by twelve the family
solicitor had arrived from London. Hastily
placing a screen in front of the child, the
Squire admitted the solicitor, nervously
locking the door after him, and always
keeping himself between the solicitor and
little Rupert.</p>

<p>"Mr. Pergamen," said the Squire, "I have
decided to convey this house&mdash;I beg you will
follow me&mdash;convey this house to one, John
Puddifoot, grocer, of this village; to be his
absolutely, without&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The family solicitor started up and gasped,
but the Squire waved him into silence with
his hand, continuing:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yes, to alienate from myself, and my son,
our ancestral home, 'Grange'&mdash;the house
which has belonged to the family since the
end of Henry VIII., the same, Mr. Pergamen,
the same&mdash;<i>the</i> house, <i>this</i> house, Grange.
You are aware, of course, that the existing
owner has the power to do this? Eh?
'Make a temporary arrangement of it'?"
continued the Squire, answering the solicitor's
suggestion more to himself than to the
suggester. "No&mdash;no&mdash;no! That might not
suffice; no, I won't risk it&mdash;no, no, no! Be
kind enough to prepare the necessary deeds
at once&mdash;<i>at once</i>. '<i>Remember my heir?</i>' I
<i>am</i> remembering my heir, sir! Be kind
enough to bring me the deeds the moment
they are ready, and I will sign them.</p>

<p>"Yes, John Puddifoot, grocer, of the village
of Grangeham. Stay&mdash;kindly write out a
provisional declaration of transfer <i>now</i>, and I
will sign it."</p>

<p>"To make this transfer of your property to
the grocer legal, there must be a consideration,"
said the solicitor; "shall we say
<i>Natural Love and Affection?</i>&mdash;Very good."</p>

<p>So the half-dazed solicitor drew it up, and
the Squire signed it; and then the solicitor
went away to prepare the formal deed; and
the haggard Squire, catching up the child,
hastily dressed him, carried him down to the
hall, keeping his own body between his
burden and all whom he passed, and, throwing
on his great grey overcoat and drawing it over
the child so as to conceal him as far as
possible, hurried out and went straight away
to the shop of John Puddifoot, grocer, and
plunged straight into the little back parlour.</p>

<p>"Come in here, Puddifoot&mdash;come in here,
and lock the door behind you!" cried the
Squire, placing the child on a chair in the
darkest corner, and standing at bay, as it
were, in front of it.</p>

<p>"John Puddifoot, I have long been
troubled with misgivings as to the happiness
and welfare of those over whose lot I
exercise a considerable influence. I do not
know, in short, whether the tenants on my
estate are as happy as they should be. This
has worried me, Puddifoot; and I have
decided that it is my duty to inquire into the
matter; and it seems to me that the most
effectual method of inquiry is to change
places with one of them.</p>

<p>"I wished to do the thing thoroughly, and
I have therefore made over my manor house,
'Grange,' unconditionally to you.</p>

<p>"My solicitor will see that all is correctly
carried out. You are now absolute master of
Grange, Puddifoot: therefore be good enough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
to go and fill your position there, leaving me
to take your place here, and learn by my own
experience whether your circumstances are as
happy as it has been my duty to make them.
Before making over the property, I left
written instructions to my&mdash;your&mdash;steward
that I should be treated here precisely the
same as you have been; and I will beg you
to allow this to stand. John!" continued
the Squire, grasping the grocer's hand and
gazing into his eyes, "I can trust you. You
will not play me false. At some future time
I <i>might</i> ask you to re-convey the house to
me, and annul this act of mine. You would
have power to refuse&mdash;but you will not!"</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 389px;">
<img src="images/i_332.jpg" width="389" height="539" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"HE WENT STRAIGHT AWAY."</p></div>
</div>

<p>The bewildered grocer began to murmur
some unintelligible ejaculations.</p>

<p>"Swear it, John Puddifoot&mdash;swear it on
all you hold sacred&mdash;here&mdash;this ledger of
yours; the very thing. Swear it, and keep
faith!"</p>

<p>Benumbed with wonder, the grocer obeyed,
scratched his head, opened his mouth three
times, but closed it again in
obedience to the Squire's uplifted
finger; and put on his hat
and walked aimlessly towards
the manor house.</p>

<p>The Squire watched him until
he had turned the distant corner;
then he locked the door again,
and commenced to search every
cupboard, drawer, and corner as
he had done at Grange. Taking
the grocer's keys&mdash;(the grocer
was a bachelor, and the maid-of-all-work
was away at the village
school)&mdash;he went all over the
house, looking in everything&mdash;even
the pockets of the grocer's
clothes; then he searched the
shop, poked about under the
rice and sugar and lentils, peered
into the tea and coffee reservoirs,
the till, the scales, the drawers,
the empty jars.</p>

<p>Only desisting now and again
to give some food to little Rupert,
he went on breathlessly at this
search until they had lighted the
evening lamp behind the red
blind of the "Vensleigh Arms"
up the hill. Then he sank on to
the sofa beside the child, and
let his head drop between his
hands, and sat, and sat, and sat.</p>

<p>"It <i>must</i> be here&mdash;it <i>must</i>&mdash;must!"
he kept muttering.
"Mrs. Wriggs herself noticed
such a little flat case in a parcel of odds
and ends bought by Puddifoot. Can he
have burned it, without opening it? Can
he have given it away? It <i>must</i> be here,
surely!"</p>

<p>Long before this the rumour of the
Squire's "madness" had gone through the
village, and many boys and a few adults had
tried to peep in through the shop window,
but they could not see in, and the shop door
had been locked all day. In the evening
Mr. Pergamen had come down again, and
had given a few of the leading villagers some
reason or other, more or less satisfying, for
the Squire's conduct. These explanations
were tame enough, but they quieted matters
down a little.</p>

<p>"It's gone&mdash;gone&mdash;gone!" muttered the
Squire. "Lost to us, Rupert! But we're
not the masters of Grange now, you and
I; we're safe, Rupert, we're safe. It can't fall
on your head now&mdash;It can't overwhelm&mdash;stay!"
Almost with a yell the Squire started<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
up. "The formal deeds are not signed
yet. I forgot that! The provisional transfer
<i>should</i> suffice. Does it? Does it? Pergamen
may not be carrying out my instructions!
He may have destroyed the declaration; but
he would not dare to destroy a deed. He
may be fooling me&mdash;temporizing. And then
the danger may <i>not</i> have passed away!"</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 652px;">
<img src="images/i_333.jpg" width="652" height="496" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"TRIED TO PEEP IN THROUGH THE SHOP WINDOW."</p></div>
</div>

<p>Again he caught up the boy, and stood as
if at bay, shielding little Rupert.</p>

<p>"I must see Pergamen," he muttered.
"Now&mdash;where can he be?"</p>

<p>There was a tap at the shop door. The
Squire snatched up his grey overcoat and
flung it over the child, and stood, white and
rigid, in front of him. But it was Mr.
Pergamen at the door; and he was admitted
and the shop door hastily locked again. And
the Squire slipped into the parlour before the
solicitor, and took up his guard in front of
the child.</p>

<p>The deeds <i>were</i> being prepared, but the
thing could not be completed at a moment's
notice.</p>

<p>Next day the Squire was searching again,
all over the house, in the back yard, among
the empty packing-cases and tea-boxes, on
the dust-heap; again it was evening before
he gave over and sank down on the
sofa, but his mind seemed a little more
at rest now.</p>

<p>At length the formal deed of transfer was
duly completed, and signed, and witnessed,
and then the Squire gave a great sigh of
relief, and a burden seemed to fall from him.
He did not draw little Rupert back and
cover him when the child advanced to talk
to the solicitor and be taken on his knee,
according to custom and usage dating from
a few months later than Rupert's appearance
in the world.</p>

<p>Then the three started off to show the
completed deed to John Puddifoot, sole
master of Grange. On the way they overtook
Mrs. Wriggs, the housekeeper, returning
from the village: the Squire stopped her
flood of lamentations with a gesture. She
dropped behind them; but presently came
up and said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, Sir Rupert&mdash;I thought I had better
mention it, perhaps&mdash;John tells me that he
saw Mr. Puddifoot, the grocer, hand over
some of the trifles he bought at the sale to
Benton, the old labourer, and he <i>thinks</i> there
was a little flat case among them."</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;just so. It was a very trifling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
matter, Mrs. Wriggs; and I had forgotten
all about it," said the Squire, hurriedly and
unnaturally.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There was a strange commotion in the
manor house: the servants were in the
square hall bending over something lying on
the oak floor. John Puddifoot had fallen
from the top of the great well staircase&mdash;he
was dead! Hurriedly the Squire took off the
grey overcoat and threw it over the body, to
keep the sight of death from the child.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 426px;">
<img src="images/i_334.jpg" width="426" height="628" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"'<span class="smcap">I had forgotten all about it,' said the squire.</span>"</p></div>
</div>

<p>"Poor fellow! But it was Fate, of course&mdash;Fate,"
said the Squire. "And the old
house will, of course, go to his heirs. Come,
Rupert, let us go; we have no right here."</p>

<p>"Pardon me," said the solicitor, "I could
not allow this&mdash;pardon me, Sir Rupert&mdash;this
mad whim of yours to develop its consequences
unchecked. I took care that John
Puddifoot executed a proper will, leaving the
property again to you."</p>

<p>Once more the Squire caught up the child,
and interposed himself between it and all
comers. "Please to send for George Benton,
the labourer," he said, hurriedly. "And
bring him to me in the study."</p>

<p>"George Benton," said the Squire, when
the solicitor and the labourer had joined him
in the study, "I am very anxious to carry
out a scheme I have formed for the bettering
of the condition of my tenants. You can
assist me greatly. I believe you to be a
trustworthy man; and I am about to make
over to you this house, lately the property of
John Puddifoot, who has met with such a
deplorable accident. I may as well declare
you at once, in the presence of Mr.
Pergamen, who will testify to the
declaration, absolute owner of this
house."</p>

<p>The labourer rubbed his forehead
with a hard, broad finger, and stammered
something about asking the missis at
'ome; but the Squire cut him short
with: "You must do this thing as a
great favour to me&mdash;it is a pet fad of
mine. At some future time I may
possibly ask you to restore the property
to me. Until then&mdash;even should that
occur&mdash;consider, you will be absolute
master here; you will be well off, for a
considerable portion of the rents go with
the house. You accept?"</p>

<p>The labourer could not avoid stammering
his acceptance.</p>

<p>"You are master here," said the
Squire, quickly and nervously, as one
with misgivings; "behave as master&mdash;I
and&mdash;and Master Rupert are intruders
here, having no right here. Will
you oblige me by ordering us out?"</p>

<p>In a dazed, mechanical way the
labourer did as he was requested.</p>

<p>"May I find a home, for a day or
two, in your cottage?&mdash;ah, it would be a
convenience. Thank you," said the
Squire; and in another ten minutes he
had arrived at the cottage and packed off
the labourer's wife and children to
Grange, absolutely preventing her, by
voluble assurances of the safety of all her
belongings, from taking away any articles
with her.</p>

<p>Then the door was locked; and the
searching began over again, and lasted the
rest of the day.</p>

<p>Day followed day: the new transfer had
been duly executed; John Benton was legal
owner of Grange. Every day the Squire
listened eagerly for all news of him, always
dreading what he should hear; but the
labourer went on in his new dignity&mdash;a fish
out of water, awkward and sheepish, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
always with a determination to preserve the
property, under the advice and assistance of
Mr. Pergamen, for the Squire. The labourer's
wife kept the same end sturdily in view, and
her children played with much content on
the smooth lawns. All the while, though
with diminishing hope and eagerness, the
Squire kept up his search for that something,
never saying a word of it to a soul, but
catching at any little chance scrap of information
likely to assist him. He would call
at the cottages and, whenever the opportunity
occurred, surreptitiously peep and pry into
drawers and cupboards&mdash;in vain.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 640px;">
<img src="images/i_335.jpg" width="640" height="441" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"THE LABOURER'S WIFE AND CHILDREN."</p></div>
</div>

<p>After a few weeks he would take little
Rupert by the hand, and they would stand and
gaze over the railings at the small Bentons
playing on the lawn; and the little Bentons
would pull their forelocks, and curtsey, and
open the gate and beg them to come in.</p>

<p>Then Rupert would play with them a little,
and was allowed to. Finally Mrs. Benton
came as a deputation from her husband to beg
the Squire to live in his own rooms in the
house; but the Squire hastily, and rather incoherently,
excused himself. Still things went
on quietly: and one evening the Squire consented
to occupy his old bedroom for the
night, and his study for the next day; and
then he found himself staying in the house.
But every time Benton touched his hair to
him, or Mrs. Benton dropped him a curtsey,
he would look round for Rupert and take
him up, and protest that he was not master
there, nor Master Rupert either, and look
anxious and nervous.</p>

<p>And one day
he drew Mr. Pergamen,
as he
passed, into the
study, and closed
the door, and
said: "I may as
well tell you now.
It is lost and
gone beyond hope.
Perhaps the spell
is broken&mdash;by the&mdash;the
death of
that unfortunate
John Puddifoot&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>The spell?</i>"
repeated the
solicitor, staring
dubiously at him.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;the
spell," said the
Squire. "You
will put me down
as a superstitious lunatic when you hear
what I have to say. "Well, do so. You
did not know of the existence of a
talisman&mdash;a charm&mdash;call it what you will&mdash;in
my family? No. Nor has anyone
ever known of it except the successive owners
of Grange and their heirs; yet this charm
has been handed down (and the tradition
connected with it) from father to heir without
a break since the time of James the First.</p>

<p>"It was a small, flat, gold disc, set with a
carbuncle carved in the shape of a skull, and
contained in a small, flat, leather case; and
the tradition was to the effect that, should
that charm cease to be under the roof of this
house, the owner, or his heir, would meet with
a violent death, a like result following the
communication of the secret to anyone but
the actual heir of the house. After that
rummage-sale I missed it; looking, by
chance, in the safe in this room where it had
always been kept, I saw that it was not in its
place. Then I recollected that, on the occasion
of my opening the safe about six
weeks before, Rupert had looked in and taken
up several of the articles to look at, as a child
will. He must have taken out the talisman,
unnoticed by me, and left it about the room
instead of putting it back; and I jumped to
the conclusion that it must have found its
way into the sale, and been carried away.</p>

<p>"It is gone, and the revealing of the secret
does not matter now; and let us hope that
the&mdash;the accident of the staircase has&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Quite so; we will hope so," replied the
solicitor, still eyeing the Squire dubiously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span></p>

<p>As the Squire chanced to turn to the
window and look out, he saw Benton entering
one of the fields beyond the lane, to bring in
a bull which was pastured there, and over
which he alone had any control. But the
animal did not seem to be so amenable as
usual to his influence; and, before the Squire
could realize the situation, the bull had
charged and tossed the labourer, and was
trampling him.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 638px;">
<img src="images/i_336.jpg" width="638" height="339" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"THE ANIMAL DID NOT SEEM TO BE SO AMENABLE AS USUAL."</p></div>
</div>

<p>The Squire snatched up a rifle, loaded,
and raised the piece; but by this time three
other men were driving off the beast with
stones; and in two minutes more they carried
Benton outside the gate. One of them
came running to the house; the Squire
called to him, asking about the injured man.</p>

<p>"Dying, sir," was the answer.</p>

<p>The revealing of the secret <i>had</i> mattered;
and its result had come quickly!</p>

<p>The Squire shuddered and covered his
face. The scene just enacted led his mind
to the scene at the foot of the staircase&mdash;the
object covered with the grey overcoat. He
uncovered his face to notice what he had
seen, but not noticed, previously&mdash;little
Rupert lying on the sofa covered with that
coat!</p>

<p>The coat had, after the tragedy, been
taken to the study and hung over a chair,
where it had remained until, half an hour
ago, Mrs. Wriggs had thrown it over the
sleeping child to keep him warm.</p>

<p>Shuddering again, the Squire plucked the
coat off Rupert, and flung it through the
open window, placing a skin over the boy in
its place.</p>

<p>Then he turned again to see them carrying
in the victim of the bull, and was suddenly
conscious of a slight cracking noise in the
ceiling of the room and the sound of something
falling.</p>

<p>A heavy carved boss had detached itself
from the mullioned ceiling and fallen upon
the head of the sleeping child; the boss bore
a shield on which was a golden disc, bearing
in its centre a red skull.</p>

<p>Rupert was dead!</p>

<p>One of the servants found the grey coat
lying on the lane outside; his attention was
attracted by something which had found its
way beneath the lining of the skirt.</p>

<p>There was a hole in the pocket where the
sewing had given way, permitting the object
to slip through: the object was a small, flat
leathern case. It had been placed in the
pocket, for fun, by Rupert on that day when
he had played with the things in the safe.</p>

<p>Until flung from the window, the grey coat
had never been away from Grange except
during the short time when John Puddifoot
had been owner.</p>
